This week Carl and Mark interview Billy Hollis, noted speaker and .NET expert. Billy and Rockford Lhotka had the first VB.NET book on the market from Wrox Press. Since then, Billy has taught VB.NET classes and done consulting for major companies, as well as authoring (or co-authoring) at least 8 books on .NET. 

He is the MSDN Regional Director (RD) for Tennessee, and was RD of the year in 2001. He authors many articles, including a regular column at MSDN called Adventures in VB.NET 

Billy talks about ASP.NET vs Smart Client applications, Remoting, and offers lots of great advice and information to VB.NET programmers.
