Carl and Mark have an enlightening talk with Juval Löwy about COM+ Enterprise Services, and how they relate to .NET. If you thought Enterprise Services (COM+) was just about Transactions and Object Pooling, you've got to check this out. Juval believes that we will all be using Enterprise Services in the near future because it will be time-prohibitive (and therefore cost-prohibitive) not to do so.
