Carl and Mark have a great chat with Jonathan Zuck about protecting the free market system from anti-competitive legislation championed by companies that want to use Washington to limit the power and effectiveness of their competitors. Not only that, but they talk about some new announcements by Microsoft about what we can expect from new versions, and from Microsoft in the immediate future.
