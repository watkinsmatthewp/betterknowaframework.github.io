Alan has a lot to say about programming, programmers, and focuses intently on what's wrong with programming as we know it. Why do businesspeople fear programmers? Is the construction of software managed? These topics and more are the focus of this monumental episode of .NET Rocks! 

Alan tells the story of that meeting where he showed Visaul Basic (then code-named Ruby) to Bill Gates and his people.
