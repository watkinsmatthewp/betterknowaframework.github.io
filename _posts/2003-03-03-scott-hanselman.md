Mark Dunn is on temporary leave in Redmond, WA this week teaching a beta Architecture class. Scott and Carl chat about .NET, C#, Reflection, Regular Expressions, Freeware, Code Sharing, Config Files, Sockets, Multi-Threaded programming, and a laundry list of Scott's favorite utilities (shown below) that you just have to check out. 

We had a few comments that the shows were not loud enough. So, starting with this show the volume has been maximized.
