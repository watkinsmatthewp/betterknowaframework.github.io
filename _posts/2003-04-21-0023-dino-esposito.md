Dino shares some valuable tips and insights into the innerworkings of ASP.NET security, IIS Impersonation, how VIEWSTATE is encoded, the serialization engine, how to store encrypted values in the registry, inline code vs. CodeBehind, and Italian Rock bands. We also learn that Dino has an extreme distaste for barbeque. 

Dino shares some topics of some of his best articles, including an ASP.NET control that generates a bar chart with pure html tables. He talks about one of the talks that he'll be doing at DevConnections in which he shows you how to write Plug-ins that users can add into your applications. 

He also talked about his new 1000-page book, Programming Microsoft ASP.NET
