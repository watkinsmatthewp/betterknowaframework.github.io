Carl and Mark talk to Jorge about how developers think, their approach to problem solving, how Microsoft makes development too easy sometimes, and about how developers think of their role in their companies. 

This is a fun interview. We even got to talk about music (Jorge is a bass player) and booze (of course!) in Peru
