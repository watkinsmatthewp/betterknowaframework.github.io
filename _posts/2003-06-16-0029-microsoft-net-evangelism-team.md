This show is a lively and candid conversation with three members of the Microsoft .NET Evangelism team.  In this episode Mark takes a break to enjoy his sons last baseball game of the season. Carl talks to the team about what they do and how their efforts impact the quality of the framework and developer tools in general. 
Get a behind-the-scenes look at the daily operations of the .NET Evangelism team and how it operates. Other topics include companies that Microsoft has worked with as early adopters, Visual Basic.NET vs C#, why Regional Directors are so special (grin), why web services are the new focus of the .NET moniker and why it gives developers severe acid reflux, why developers are still stuck on nanosecond-level performance differences, differences between DevDays; Tech-Ed; and the Professional Developers Conference (PDC). Fascinating stuff. Also, Carl plays a wicked cool guitar piece in lieu of the first ad spot!
