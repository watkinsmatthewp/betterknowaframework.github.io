This week Carl and Mark got to do a show they've been waiting for a long time to do. The conversation touches on the new application blocks (bluebricks - from the MS Patterns and Practices Group), string handling, using the BitConverter class for fast file i/o, serialization, XMLDataDocuments and XSLT, inheritance, instrumentation, the ASP.NET Cache object, and some great stories from the trenches, especially Mark's great training stories which always contain an array of shady characters and companies. All in all, its an hour well spent for .NET developers
