Mark and Carl talk with Brent about intellectual property, namely assembly and application obfuscation: techniques used, and the resultant binaries. They also talk about Remoting and get Brent's take on the value of Remoting. 

But the big gem in this show, we think, is Brent's 5-minute description of how Code Access Security works, which we immediately recognize as something very special.
