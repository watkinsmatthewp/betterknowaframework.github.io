This week Carl and Mark throw down a few pints at the historic Dutch Tavern in downtown New London, CT and you're invited! Listen to stories from their recent week of teaching a VB.NET class to 27 people, challenging code puzzles, interesting characters, and of course, beer.

This is a very relaxed show, but don't think you won't learn a thing or two. C'mon! Just have one more Black and Tan! 
Note: The show starts out a bit noisy, then gets better. There were some rowdy people in there when we first started recording, and they left shortly afterwords.
