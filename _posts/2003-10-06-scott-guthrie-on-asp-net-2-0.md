Carl and Mark chat with Scott about the new features of ASP.NET 2.0 (code-named Whidbey). Scott's keen understanding of the high and low-level features of Whidbey, Yukon, and IIS 6.0 really shine through in this interview where the topics include performance, caching and cache dependency, VS.NET tools, data access, using Yukon with ASP.NET 2.0, sharing session state, backward-compatibility, and code enhancements as well as a time-frame for when to expect alphas, betas, and the like.
