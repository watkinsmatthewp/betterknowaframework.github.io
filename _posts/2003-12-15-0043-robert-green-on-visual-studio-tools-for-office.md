Carl and Mark talk to Robert about the new Visual Studio Tools for Office, VBA, XML, Office and DataSets, Scripting, and using Word and Excel as the User Interface layer for your .NET framework applications. 

Robert also talks about some features of up-coming versions of these tools in the Whidbey timeframe. This is great stuff!
