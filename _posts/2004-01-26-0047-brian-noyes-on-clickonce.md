In our first post-Mark show, Carl interviews developer and author Brian Noyes. Brian has focused his studies and development efforts on Smart Client development, and in this interview brings us from AutoDeployment of Windows Forms applications into ClickOnce, the next-generation deployment and update technology from Microsoft that will ship with the .NET Framework 2.0.  We talk about the issues around AutoDeployment, and how Microsoft is addressing those issues with ClickOnce.
