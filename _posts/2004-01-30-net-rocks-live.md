Hey, it's our first Live .NET Rocks! Show EVER! Oh yeah, we recorded a show live at the PDC, but we didn't broadcast it live! What's more, Carl's co-host is none-other than the infamous Rory Blyth

This show is 2 hours long, and commenced Friday, January 30, 2004 at 12PM EST, 9AM PST. 

In the first hour, Bill Vaughn and Peter Blackburn talk about SQL Reporting Services, Microsoft's foray into the data reporting market.

In the second hour, Carl and Rory welcome noted VB and PC guru Dan Appleman to talk about marketing hype, how developers are spending their time, and his new book Always Use Protection

Rory is moving to New London March 1st. So, the new live show format will commence March 5th, and will be only format for .NET Rocks! going forward. Remember! Friday's at Noon Eastern!
