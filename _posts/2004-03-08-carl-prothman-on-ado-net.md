This week, Carl and Rory talk with noted ADO and ADO.NET guru Carl Prothman about ASP.NET, being an MVP, INETA, ADO.NET, ASP.NET Security and Visual Studio.NET. 

There were lots of callers during the show. This may be the best show we've ever done on ADO and ADO.NET issues. CP also talked about how to prevent the most common types of ASP.NET attacks.

Regular segments: Fan mail, Google Weirdos, Linux Vulnerability of the week, and a lucky listener wins a copy of Windows Server 2003 Enterprise with 25 licenses compliments of the Microsoft Regional Director Program

Rory also unleashed some of his own music during the intermission! All in all, this is a very informative and lively show.
