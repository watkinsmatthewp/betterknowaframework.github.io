Carl and Rory talk with Kevin about ObjectSpaces (a new business object management tool coming in the Whidbey timeframe), UML, Object Role Modeling (ORM), Visio, and his Mere Mortals Framework, an application framework for .NET developers based on best practices and patterns. This is a good show for anyone interested in using patterns and practices, maximizing development time, and tools the help you design and build business objects.
