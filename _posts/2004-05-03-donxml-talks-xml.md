Rory somehow convinced DonXML to drive up to the .NET Rocks! Studios for our first Thursday-night live show.Don Demsak (a.k.a. DonXML) is all about XML and related technologies, and as such he told us Why XML? for the as-of-yet unbeliever. Other topics include what the community gets wrong with XML, what's wrong with typed datasets, Object Constraint Language (OCL), what's wrong with the XML DOM, declarative programming and XAML, and SVG.
