What started out as a show about the DevConnections Developer Conference morphed into a round-table chat with Dan Appleman, Kathleen Dollard, Mark Dunn, Don Kiely, Robert Scoble, Chris Sells, and Bill Vaughn about developer conferences like DevConnections, writing books, speaking, and various other aspects of the industry. Of course, it was lots of fun too.
