In this, our first show after a much-needed vacation, we take you to TechEd 2004 in San Diego. We walked around on the show floor and talked to some of our former and future guests about TechEd, what's new, and what they're interested in.We recorded most of this show on video, and as such will be airing ".NET Rocks! The Movie" as soon as we possibly can. Until then, enjoy some of the more interesting sonic tidbits of the film.In the first half we spoke to Tim Huckaby, Keith Nicholson, Billy Hollis, Don Kiely, Stephen Forte, Don Box, and Jon Lam.In the second half, we spent about 40 minutes in an INETA Birds Of a Feather (BOF) Session that we recorded Sunday night, in which Bob Reselman showed up and got things juiced up. There is also a lot of obvious interest in the Visual Studio Team System, which was announced at TechEd. We spoke with Paul Sheriff, Brian Noyes, and Chris Kinsman about their impressions of the Team System, and then we caught up with some Microsft team members to talk about it.
