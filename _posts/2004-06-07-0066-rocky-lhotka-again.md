Rocky Lhotka talks about his new book, the CSLA framework, and makes the case for business objects in this world of DataSets and XML. He also talked a bit about WhiteHorse, Microsoft's new designers for SOA and classes shipping in the Whidbey timeframe. This was a great show, and we're always glad to talk to Rocky about all things .NET.
