This week we had a very informative discussion about messaging with Benjamin Mitchell and John Bristowe. Benjamin and John cut through the WS-AlphabetSoup set of specifications, avoid frequent references to SOA and cover what the benefits of web services are, why you might want to use WSE (security, policy, addressing and support for TCP), how to use web services in your applications today and where Microsoft is heading with web services and Indigo in future.  Michele Leroux Bustamante joined us unexpectedly in the second half, and she even told a great joke!
