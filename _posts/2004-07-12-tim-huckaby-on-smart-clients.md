Tim Huckaby stops by to talk about his mission of preaching the SmartClient gospel. Tim is always full of fun, great stories, and common sense. Nickolas Landry surprises us by calling in and heckling Tim. Rory does the Google Weirdos and News of the Week, Carl scraps the Linux Vulnerability of the week (it was time) and Richard Campbell (the Toy Boy) reviews the nVidia GeForce 6800 (as well as a not-so-cool toy) and Carl gives one away to a lucky listener! All in all this was a great show!
