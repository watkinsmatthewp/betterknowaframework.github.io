DotNetNuke is a free ASP.NET based content management system with a huge installbase and support community. Shaun Walker is it's creator, and Jim Duffy is probably its biggest evangelist. This is a great laid-back show in which you'll learn all about DotNetNuke. By the end of the show you'll be rushing off to download it!
