Charles Petzold talks with Carl and Rory about his books including Programming Windows; Code; and his .NET books, his love of computer and math history, his exploits with early electronic music, and tells some stories from the old days (at the prodding of old friend, Richard Hale Shaw, who was listening to the live stream at the time). This is a great discussion with a great man. Charles has a way of making complex concepts easy to understand.
