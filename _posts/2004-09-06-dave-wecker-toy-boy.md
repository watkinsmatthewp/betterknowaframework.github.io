This weeks show is an interesting conversation with Dave Wecker, a brilliant (we think) architect in the Mobile Platforms Division who is constantly looking for the next thing in mobility, and how to make the mobile platforms better. The conversation spans from his experiences with speech recognition systems, the Tablet PC, microphone arrays, and neural networks to toys, home automation, books, and toys. Did we mention toys? Dave is a Toy Boy like us!  It's people like Dave that make Microsoft the leader in software innovation.
