Joe Stagner stopped by to talk about his recent experiences at BorCon, experiences with the Open Source community, Java, and Delphi. In the second half we talked about Rory joining the MSDN evangelism team, VB.NET 2005, the CLR 2.0, XP Service Pack 2 and website security. Joe did a session at TechEd 2004 called "How Hackers Hack" which was the number two highest-attended session! This was a great talk with a very talented developer turned evangelist who keeps it real every day. Also, Mail, News of the Week, Weird Wide Webb, Ask Rory, and Richard the Toy Boy.
