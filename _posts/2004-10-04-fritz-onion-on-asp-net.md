Noted author and software engineer Fritz Onion is our guest this week on .NET Rocks! After lavishing praise on F.O. for what seemed an eternity, Carl and Rory get down to the HTTP Pipeline, the HTTPContext, User Controls, Web Controls, and what Fritz likes (and dislikes) about the current beta of ASP.NET 2.0. Among other accomplishments, Fritz is the author of the best-selling Essential ASP.NET published by Addison Wesley.
