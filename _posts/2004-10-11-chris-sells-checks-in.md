.NET Rocks! regular guest (and guest host) Chris Sells joins Carl and the gang for a really fun discussion (after he comments on the mail and news) about Longhorn and WinFX, Longhorn features on XP, working on the MSDN Smart Client DevCenter, VS.NET 2005, learning about new technologies, learning by teaching, and Avalon. He answers some good technical questions from live listeners, and overall makes the two hours fly by. Of course you get the mail, news of the week, Weird Wide Webb, and Ask Rory. Richard is away this week so Carl gave away an iPod to a lucky listener!
