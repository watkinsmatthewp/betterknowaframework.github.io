We try to have representatives from Microsoft on the show every once in a while to talk about what's happening in Redmond. This week we had four program managers for the Evangelism team: Scott Burmester, Steve Cellini, Carter Maslan, and Jeff Sandquist. The topic? Whidbey! We get a check up on the progress of the next version of .NET. We talked at length about the up-and-coming Visual Studio 2005 Team System, and the efforts to reach application developers who don't necessarily spend time in the development community. We also ask each of them to tell us something about Whidbey that we probably don't already know. All in all it's a good show, even if Rory and Richard are on vacation.
