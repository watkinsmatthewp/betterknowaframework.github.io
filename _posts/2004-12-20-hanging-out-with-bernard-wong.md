Bernard Wong from MSDN talks with Carl and Rory this week. What's on his mind? For starters, the old and tired questions asked of him at developer conferences, what Bill and Steve really say at those high level meetings in Redmond, amrchair CEOs, and other observations. Bernard always has great stories to tell. This is the last show of 2004. We'll be back on January 10th, 2005! Until then, we hope everyone enjoys a little time off for the holidays!
