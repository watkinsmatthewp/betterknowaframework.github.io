As the original co-host of .NET Rocks!, mark didn't say all that much. Well, look out! He's talking about his current passions, ADO.NET 2.0 and BizTalk 2004, and we can't shut him up! This is a great conversation with a true ADO.NET expert. Mark has a knack for explaining complex ideas in a very natural and easy manner.  If you still don't get BizTalk, this is the show to listen to. Mark explains why BizTalk is great from a very practical perspective, and explains why he is on a crusade to get developers as excited about BizTalk as IT managers are.
