Chris Maxwell and Randy Kim from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration talk about their recent .NET project, World Wind, an educational and informational tool for viewing planet Earth (and other planets). The program was written in Visual Studio .NET with managed DirectX, and is open source.  Geoff steps out from behind the sound board and ends up asking most of the really good questions.
