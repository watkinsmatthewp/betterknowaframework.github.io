Scott Hanselman returns to DNR for the first time in several months.  In this otherwise ASP.NET-centric show, Rory shows off his hands-free flush abilities and Scott rants about Cascading Style Sheets.  A great show with more nutritional value than you might expect.  Welcome back to the show, Rory!
