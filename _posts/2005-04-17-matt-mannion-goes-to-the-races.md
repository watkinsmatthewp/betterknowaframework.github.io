Matt Mannion from Clarity Consulting talks about the application his company developed with and for the Indy Racing League in Indianappolis, IN. Using Visual Studio .NET 2003 and VB.NET they were able to develop a great application for managing real-time racing data and reporting. Fascinating story.
