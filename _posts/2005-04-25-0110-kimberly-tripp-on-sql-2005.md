Kim Tripp is back and more intense than ever. After talking about her famous USB Key demonstration of SQL 2005 partitioning, she gets into details of SQL 2005 that would make even the SQL team go "hey, that's cool!" This is one of those shows that you'll have to listen to several times to completely grasp. We know we will!
