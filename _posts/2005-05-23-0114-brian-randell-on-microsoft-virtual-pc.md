We thought we were going to cover a lot of topics in this episode of Dot Net Rocks, but we managed to go over an hour without straying from Virtual PC at all.  This is a must-listen show for anyone who isn't already an expert in Virtual PC or Virtual Server.  Brain Randell explains the advantages and disadvantages, warns you of some potential pitfalls, and shows you how you can boost performance!
