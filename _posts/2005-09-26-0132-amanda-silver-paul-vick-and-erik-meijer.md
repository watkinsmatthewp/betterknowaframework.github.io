Carl and Richard interview three members of the Visual Basic team at PDC 2005. The conversation turns from favorite features of VB 2005 to LINQ to XML in VB.2005 to Orcas, best and worst moments on the VB team. We are also treated to a short after-dinner converation with Ted Pattison, George Bullock, Joe Hummel, and David Chappell.
