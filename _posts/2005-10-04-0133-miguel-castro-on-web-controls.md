Carl and Richard run into Miguel Castro at a hotel bar at the MVP Summit 2005 in Bellevue, WA. This is the first real show we've done on Web Controls, and it has been a long time coming. There is so much technical information in this show you'll have to listen several times at possibly a slower speed.
