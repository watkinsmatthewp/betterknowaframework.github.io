Only a week after returning from a 30-day trip through the interior of the American heartland, we found ourselves in Merry Old England speaking at and attending the VBUG Winter Conference. Carl moderated a Code-Off in which four developers each created a user interface for a system of web services, each using a different technology. They then showed off those applications in a very small window of time. Immediately following this, we interviewed them in front of the audience. We also spoke one-on-one to Graham Parker, one of the code-off developers, about VBUG and the UK .NET community.

Note: The sound is a bit off during this show because we didn't have control over the audio. :-)
