This week Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell interview Shawn Wildermuth about his experiences in the trenches with ADO.NET. He's down on datasources as a one-size-fits-all solution to data access. He talks about his upcoming book in which he attempts to organize projects into archetypes, and helps the reader determine which archetype thier project is closest to, so he can give his recommendations.
