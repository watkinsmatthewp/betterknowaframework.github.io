Australian Regional Director Adam Cogan is known for his rules. In fact, if you work for his software company you can expect to get up every morning at 6AM for exercises. You'll also have to digest hundreds and hundreds of best practices and rules that he has compiled from his many years in the software business. In this show we point you to the rules, and even discuss a few of them. Not to be missed.
