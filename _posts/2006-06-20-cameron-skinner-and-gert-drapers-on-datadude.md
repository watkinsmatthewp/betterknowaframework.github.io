DataDude is the code name for Microsoft Visual Studio Team System for Database Professionals, announced shortly before TechEd in June, 2006. Carl and Richard interviewed Cameron Skinner and Gert Drapers from the DataDude team on June 12th at TechEd, in this somewhat shorter-than-usual but very informative live .NET Rocks! episode.
