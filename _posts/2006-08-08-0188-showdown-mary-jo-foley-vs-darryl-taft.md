Noted journalists Mary Jo Foley and Darryl K Taft on loan from eWeek magazine are in the studio in a head to head discussion around topical issues concerning Microsoft. The gloves come off and they don't stop until there's carnage on the floor! OK, it's not that ugly, but you won't want to miss it.
