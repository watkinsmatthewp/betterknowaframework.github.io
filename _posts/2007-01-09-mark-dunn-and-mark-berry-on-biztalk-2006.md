Mark Berry and Mark Dunn from DUNN Training join us this week to dig a little deeper into BizTalk Server 2006.  In this gripping sequel to Mark's earlier BizTalk shows, we delved much deeper into the inner workings of BizTalk than we've ever gone before.  These guys know their stuff and you can bet this show will be educational and even a wee bit entertaining.
