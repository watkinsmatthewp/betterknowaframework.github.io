Carl and Richard interview Peter Kuhn from the Scripps Institute about an application he designed to allow cancer researchers to visualize molecules and annotate them with real time collaboration. The application was written with beta versions of WPF, and champoined by Tim Huckaby's team at Interknowlogy and evangelized by Eileen Rumwell and Stephen Forte. This is an amazing success story.
