Jon Harrop introduces Carl and Richard to F#, a functional language that runs under the CLR. F# performs like C#, but being a functional language, has interactive scripting (similar to Python) but is rooted in the strong type inference and safety that other functional languages like ML focus on. Being in the CLR means you can build certain parts of your application in F# and then reference them from other languages, the same way VB.NET and C# interoperate.
