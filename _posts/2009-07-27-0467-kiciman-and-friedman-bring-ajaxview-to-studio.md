Emre Kiciman and Mark Friedman talk about bringing AjaxView to Visual Studio. Emre previously talked about AjaxView on .NET Rocks when it was a Microsoft Research project to enable developers to profile the behavior of JavaScript on the browser. Since then, AjaxView has been developed as the Microsoft Visual Studio AJAX Profiling Extensions. Mark as part of the Studio team focused on making AjaxView work in Studio. The conversation not only digs into what AjaxView can do for a developer, but the challenges of bringing a research project to the mainstream.
