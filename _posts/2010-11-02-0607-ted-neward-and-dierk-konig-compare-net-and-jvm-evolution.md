While at DevCon in London, Carl and Richard hosted a discussion with guests Ted Neward and Dierk Konig about the differences and similarities between .NET and the JVM. The discussion ranges over the different languages that are implemented against the platform, how the ownership model of the platforms differs and how that impacts the evolution, right down to how to make the two platforms work and play well with each other.
