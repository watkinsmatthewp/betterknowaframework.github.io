Carl and Richard talk to Jon Skeet and Bill Wagner about C#. Both Jon and Bill have published books on C# and have reach each other's work. But C# is such a vast language, there are plenty of things that are subject to interpretation. We could have called this show a C# Smackdown, but these guys are too nice for such a thing!
