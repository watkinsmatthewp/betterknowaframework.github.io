While at Oredev 2010 in Malm√∂, Sweden, Carl and Richard got to interview some of the great thinkers and doers of .NET. The first interview is with Jon Skeet, who talks about the upcoming Async features in C# 5. Next, Glenn Block talks about where WCF is going and the move to put WCF source at wcf.codeplex.com. Finally, Ade Miller digs into how parallel development is becoming a focus at Microsoft. This is the first in a series of shows from Oredev 2010.
