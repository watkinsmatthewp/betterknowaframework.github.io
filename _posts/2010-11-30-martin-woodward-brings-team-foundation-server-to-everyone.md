Carl and Richard talk to Martin Woodward about Team Foundation Server being used for more than just .NET development. Martin used to work for Teamprise until the technology was acquired by Microsoft in 2009 and he made the transition from being an MVP to being a 'blue badge'. The conversation ranges over the new features of TFS 2010, how Java developers can also use TFS, the effects of different process templates in TFS, and more!
