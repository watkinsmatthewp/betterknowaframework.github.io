Carl and Richard chat with Microsoft Vice President and all around great guy, Scott Guthrie. Scott talks about some of the new features coming in Silverlight 5. The conversation jumps over to HTML 5 toward the end, focusing on what ASP.NET will support in the space. Apologies for Carl's phone track. We'll try to be better people. :)
