Carl and Richard talk to Shaun Walker, CTO of DotNetNuke Corp. Last time Shaun was on the show, the commercial version of DotNetNuke was just starting out. Shaun brings us up to date on the state of the business, the balance between community and commercial, and the evolution of the store front for the thousands of plug-in products for DotNetNuke.
