Carl and Richard talk to Joel Semeniuk about the state of Team Foundation Server (TFS) today. Joel digs into how TFS has moved into the cloud and is reaching a larger span of developers. The conversation digs into how to split the work of development up between cloud and premise - source code on the cloud, builds locally, etc.
