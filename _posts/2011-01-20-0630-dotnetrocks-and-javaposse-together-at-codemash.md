Carl and Richard participated in a panel discussion at Codemash 2011 on January 12, 2011 alongside the hosts of the popular Java Posse podcast. The discussion was moderated by Barry Hawkins. They talked about the differences and similarities between the Java and .NET ecosystems, the origins of their podcast (and ours), and more. Even if you're not a Java developer this is great stuff.
