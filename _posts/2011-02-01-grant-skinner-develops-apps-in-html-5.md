Carl and Richard talk to Grant Skinner about Pirates Love Daisies, an HTML 5 game. The game runs on all of the HTML 5 browsers including IE 9 Beta. The conversation also digs into Easel JS, an open-source library that Grant helped create to make Pirates, simplifying the animation process on HTML 5 canvas.
