Carl and Richard talk to Udi Dahan about Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS). CQRS is an enterprise application pattern derived from the DDD movement, where responsibility for data integrity and consistency lies soley in the application itself. The conversation digs deeply into using caching intelligently - not just create and expire, but actual maintenance of caching with a publication approach. Udi is the software simplist and makes this potentially confusing pattern absolutely clear!
