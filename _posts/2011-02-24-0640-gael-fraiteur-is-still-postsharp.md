Carl and Richard talk to Gael Fraiteur about the state of PostSharp and Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). Gael talks about the advantage of AOP, modifying applications without changing source code by using post-compilation techniques. He digs into different examples of using AOP to add features without burying business code in the plumbing. Finally Gael talks about the evolution of PostSharp into community and retail versions and what is coming in version 2.1.
