Carl and Richard talk to Giorgio Sardo about the IE9 Release Candidate. Giorgio talks about his experience with Imagine Cup a few years back before diving into what's new in IE9. These features include geolocation and Web Open Font Format. Giorgio also digs into the test strategies of IE9 as well as performance. When will IE9 be released? Giorgio won't say!
