Carl and Richard talk to Bruce Lawson and Remi Sharp about HTML 5. Bruce and Remy have been involved with HTML 5 from the early days, although more as activists than movers-and-shakers. They provide some great insight into how HTML 5 has come to be and how regular developers can get involved and affect the outcome of an important specification. Bruce and Remy have one of the very first books out on HTML 5, creatively named Introduction to HTML 5.
