Carl and Richard talk to Scott Millett about SpecFlow, a free tool to help you implement Behaviour Driven Design. SpecFlow lets you build plain text requirements that actually connect with code and tests to help reinforce acceptance testing. The conversation also wanders over design patterns in general and ASP.NET specifically. Scott also talks through the various free tools he uses together to build better software.
