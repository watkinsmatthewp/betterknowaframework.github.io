Carl and Richard talk to Adam Driscoll of Quest Software. The conversation starts with a discussion around Adam's TFS plugin for Android. Then it moves into PowerGUI and the PowerGUI extensions for Visual Studio. PowerGUI is a UI for writing PowerShell scripts and PowerGUI VSX ties PowerGUI into Studio. Adam talks about applications can be built to be PowerShell driven with UI over top to generate the PowerShell commands.
