Carl and Richard talk to Jean Paoli, the General Manager of Interoperability Strategy at Microsoft. Jean Paoli was part of the team at the W3C that created the XML specification. Jean does a great job of helping us understand how huge the interoperability effort at Microsoft is. He also digs into the iterative (almost agile!) process of developing web specifications by building prototype code and taking that experience back to the working group.
