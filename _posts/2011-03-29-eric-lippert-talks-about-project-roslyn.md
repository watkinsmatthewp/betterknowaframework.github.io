Recorded on PI day, Carl and Richard talk to the one-and-only Eric Lippert from the C# Compiler team. But we don't only talk about C#! The conversation wanders around all the languages, a little F#, a little IronPython, heck, even VB.NET! Eric talks about Project Roslyn, Microsoft's efforts to make the C# compiler available as a service. A little artificial intelligence, a little parallelism, and you've got one brain twisting show!
