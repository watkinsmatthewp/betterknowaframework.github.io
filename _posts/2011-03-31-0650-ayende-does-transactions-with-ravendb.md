Carl and Richard talk to Oren Eini, aka Ayende Rahein, about RavenDB. RavenDB is a NoSQL JSON document database. Oren explains how he came to the realization that he needed to build his own data store, and the advantages of document databases over relational databases. Is SQL dead? Not hardly, but RavenDB is an interesting addition to your data solution!
