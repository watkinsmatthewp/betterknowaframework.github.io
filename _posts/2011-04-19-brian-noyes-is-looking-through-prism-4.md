Carl and Richard talk to Brian Noyes about Prism 4. Prism is a combination of guidance and tooling from the Patterns and Practices team at Microsoft to help build WPF and Silverlight based applications. Brian digs into why Prism exists and what has been added to the latest version of Prism to work with Visual Studio 2010, Silverlight 4 and WPF 4. There's also a version for Windows Phone 7!
