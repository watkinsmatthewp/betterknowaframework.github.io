While at Mix 2011, Richard talked to Billy Hollis about XAML development. Billy talks about the balance between WPF and Silverlight work, how he chooses which approach to use. The conversation also digs into steering clear of the 'One Right Way' mindset, and how right now is a great time to be ready to experiment with new technologies - XAML, touch and even gesture.
