Richard caught up with Glenn Block at Mix 2011 to find out what he's been working on since the MEF days. After a quick tour down memory lane about MEF and Brad Abrams, Glenn discusses WCF Web APIs. The Web APIs focus WCF onto pure HTTP, making it easier to build RESTful applications while not requiring your applications to use REST. WCF Web APIs are all about creating HTTP clients and servers that do not have to be browsers and web servers, opening HTTP to a whole new world of devices and simplifying testing of your HTTP applications.
