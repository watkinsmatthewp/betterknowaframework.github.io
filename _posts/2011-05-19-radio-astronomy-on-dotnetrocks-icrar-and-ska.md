Carl and Richard talk to professors Andreas Wicenec and Kevin Vinsen of the ICRAR and SKA project. SKA is the Square Kilometer Array for radio astronomy. The concept is to build a really huge array of radio telescopes that work together to provide far deeper resolution into space. SKA plans on a first phase of 1,000 12 meter radio telescopes. Andreas and Kevin work in the Data Intensive Research Group at the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research in Western Australia and specialise in the research require to handle the massive amounts of data that will be generated SKA.
