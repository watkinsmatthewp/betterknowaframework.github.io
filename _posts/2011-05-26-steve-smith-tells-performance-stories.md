Ignoring the unusual show number, Steve Smith talks to Carl and Richard about his experiences tuning ASP.NET for better performance. Steve tells three different stories from different eras of web development, also digging into situations where he's made mistakes, where he's found mistakes, and when he wished he'd called Microsoft tech support sooner. Don't let the number scare you, this is a great show!
