While at Tech Ed US in Atlanta, Carl and Richard talked to a variety of folks about the work they're doing in .NET. First up was Geert van de Horrik, talking about the Catel MVVM framework. Then Miguel Castro talked about MVVM. We also caught up with Stephen Rose who discussed Windows InTune. And finally, Tod Anglin from Telerik talked a bit about HTML 5. These are the stories from Tech Ed!
