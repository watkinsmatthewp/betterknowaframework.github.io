While at DevTeach in Montreal, Carl and Richard sat down with a panel of mobile development experts to talk about where mobile development is at. The development process for iPhone, Android, Blackberry and Windows Phone 7 was explored. The conversation also dug into the potential of MonoTouch and Mono for Android, alternative ways of building applications for iPhone and Android respectively. Finally, the debate dug into HTML 5 and the dream of building an application once that runs on all platforms.
