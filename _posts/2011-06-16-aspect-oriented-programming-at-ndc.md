While at the Norwegian Developers Conference, Carl and Richard moderated a panel discussion on Aspect Oriented Programming. The discussion ranges over a diverse number of scenarios that aspects make sense for, how you can get in trouble with aspects, and the various aspect toolsets that exist. The audience jumps in with lots of questions for panelists.
