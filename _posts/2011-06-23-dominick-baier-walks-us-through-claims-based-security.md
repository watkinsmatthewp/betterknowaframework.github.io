While at the Norwegian Developers Conference in Oslo, Carl and Richard sat down with Dominick Baier to talk about claims-based security. Dominick walks through the entire claims-based security process, separating identity claims from resource claims, how to actually work with active directory in a sensible way and how the whole thing comes together in your code in a way that won't make you cry every time you need to make a change. The time for claims-based security is now!
