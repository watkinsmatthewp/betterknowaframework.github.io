While at the Norwegian Developers Conference in Oslo, Norway, Carl and Richard talk to Ingo Rammer about building 'native' HTML 5 apps. Ingo talks about PhoneGap, a wrapper over HTML for building applications that run on all mobile platforms. But then he goes further, talking about other variations on the idea of using HTML 5 as the presentation markup while still being able to connect to the native resources of the platform. Could this be the programming platform of the future?
