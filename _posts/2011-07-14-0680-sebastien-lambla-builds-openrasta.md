Carl and Richard talk to Sebastien Lambla about OpenRasta and OpenWrap. OpenRasta is a framework for simplifying building resource-oriented web-based applications. OpenRasta can work with ASP.NET or directly with HTTP.SYS. OpenRasta will work side-by-side with ASP.NET MVC, Webforms and more. Sebastien also talks about OpenWrap, a package manager for .NET that helps OpenRasta stay lean but extensible. Sebastien also speaks passionately about the role of Open Source in the Microsoft community.
