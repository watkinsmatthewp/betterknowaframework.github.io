Carl and Richard talk to Brad Abrams late of Microsoft, now at Google. Recently moved to Palo Alto, Brad talks about Google+, Google's social networking application for sharing thoughts, pictures and video. Brad has just joined the team to start developing API for developers to work with Google+. The conversation moves onto Google's Web Toolkit and App Engine, products Brad spent his first year at Google on. Brad digs into his thinking around building platforms, what it really means to compile, and his experiences in different company cultures.
