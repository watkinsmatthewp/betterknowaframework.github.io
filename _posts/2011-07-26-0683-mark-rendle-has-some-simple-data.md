Carl and Richard talk to Mark Rendle about Simple.Data. As Mark describes it, Simple.Data is not an ORM because there's no objects and no relational mapping. Simple.Data is a dynamic data utility to make your data persistence layer as light weight as possible. Mark also talks about Nancy, a light-weight web development framework. The conversation also moves to OWIN, the Open Web Server Interface. The show wraps up with Mark's insights on simpler, more open software.
