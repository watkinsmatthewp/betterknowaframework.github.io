Carl and Richard talk to Pete Brown from Microsoft about the cool things he's working on, including building a Commodore 64 emulator in Silverlight! Pete also touches on the fact that Silverlight is not dying at all - there's lots of good things going on! The conversation digs into Pete's favorite new features of Silverlight 5. Pete is the author of Silverlight 5 in Action, you can get a discount by using code s5ia38 at the Manning web site. Ultimately the conversation ends up on the .NET Micro Framework and MIDI - music and geekery collide!
