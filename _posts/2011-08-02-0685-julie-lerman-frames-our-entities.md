Carl and Richard talk to Julie Lerman about Entity Framework. Julie talks about her Entity Framework books - one for EF1, the other for EF4. The conversation digs into Entity Framework 4.1 and the key features added, as well as the June CTP which added even more. Julie talks about enum support in the CTP, which was the most demanded feature, but then goes onto the other cool areas of the CTP, including new model support, spatial, table-value functions and support for stored procedures that return multiple record sets. Julie gets us up to date on Entity Framework!
