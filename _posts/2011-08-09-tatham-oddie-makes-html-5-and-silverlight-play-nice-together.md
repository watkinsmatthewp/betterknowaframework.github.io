Carl and Richard talk to Tatham Oddie about building web applications using HTML 5 *and* Silverlight. Tatham talks about the idea that the two technologies are not mutually exclusive - that you can take advantage of the mix of browsers and plugins to build the best experience possible for users. The conversation also moves into data and connectivity in general, ending up on cloud platforms. Tatham talks about how Azure can't scale down far enough, that technologies like AppHarbor are filling in the bottom end of the cloud story.
