Carl and Richard talk to Shaun Walker about DotNetNuke. Shaun talks about the release of DotNetNuke 6, offering some substantial changes to DNN, including migrating to C# (from VB.NET). The conversation also digs into the lifestyle of having a dominant community (read: free) edition of your product vs. the commercial edition. Shaun also talks about how web development has evolved since the early days of ASP.NET. And it runs in Windows Azure!
