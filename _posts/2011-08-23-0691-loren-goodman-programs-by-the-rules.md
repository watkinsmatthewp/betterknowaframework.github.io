Carl and Richard talk to Loren Goodman from InRule Technologies about rule engines. Loren talks about how rule engines help applications organize rules so that non-developers can modify them. The goal is to reduce maintenance costs for software. The conversation moves over to concepts of complex event processing and how it applies to developing new rules dynamically.
