Carl and Richard talk to Kerry Hammil about .NET Gadgeteer. The .NET Gadgeteer project comes out of Microsoft Research and is advancing the .NET Micro Framework with new hardware that does not require experienced electronics people to be successful with. Everything is plug-and-play! The conversation moves on to what would happen when everything in your house has an IP address and further on into the Internet of Things. Another good geekout show!
