Carl and Richard talk to Kate Gregory about the history of C, culminating in the latest version, C++0x (aka C++ 11). Kate points out that C++ is more popular than ever, no matter what the managed memory folks are saying. The conversation works through the various flavors of C, how the language has continued to evolve, even to the point of doing memory management! Along the way Kate digs into the new features of C++0x, many of which (like lambdas) seem awfully familiar... the conversation ends on a great discussion on massive parallelism. Could C++ solve the parallel problem?
