After Richard made some (somewhat) disparaging remarks about ColdFusion, Billy sent an email defending the platform. The outcome of that email discussion is this show - Carl and Richard get educated by Billy about what ColdFusion is about. ColdFusion goes back to 1995, and is still going strong at version 10! Billy talks about the similarities and differences between ColdFusion and ASP.NET.
