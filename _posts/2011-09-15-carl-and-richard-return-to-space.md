You asked for it, you got it - another space show! This time around Carl and Richard talk about the latest news around commercial space, including new contracts for SpaceX and Orbital Science to fly to the ISS. They discuss the impact of the failure of a Russian Soyuz rocket carrying a Progress cargo ship to the ISS. Then they have some real fun and dive into the space debris debate and the potential of space elevators. Another total space geek out!
