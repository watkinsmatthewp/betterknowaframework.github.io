Carl and Richard talk to Jay Schmelzer about LightSwitch. Jay talks about the launch of LightSwitch back on July 26 2011, and the new set of extensions available to help Visual Studio Pro developers support LightSwitch applications. He also reminds us that if you own Visual Studio 2010, you own LightSwitch, so take it out for a spin!
