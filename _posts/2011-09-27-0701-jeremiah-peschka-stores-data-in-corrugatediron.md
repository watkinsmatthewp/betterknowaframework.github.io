Carl and Richard talk to Jeremiah Peschka about his project, CorrugatedIron, a .NET library that gives developers the ability to talk to Riak, Basho's highly-available Key-Value store. The conversation starts with understanding Riak, which is based on Amazon's Dynamo white paper for dynamic distributed storage. Along the way the topics of NoSQL as a whole, distributed data storage, load balancing and functional programming are explored.
