Carl and Richard talk to Guy Smith-Ferrier about the Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset. No really! Mind control for .NET! Guy talks about how the headset is wireless and works with 16 different sensors positioned around the head. The headset is able to detect expressions, head movements, cognitive thoughts and emotions. Guy discusses how the SDK makes it simple to capture the headset data into .NET. Its easy to program, the question is, what would you do?
