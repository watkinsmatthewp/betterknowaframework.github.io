Carl and Richard talk to Philip Laureano about Nemerle. Nemerle is a multi-paradigm programming language for .NET. Similar to C#, it goes beyond C# to provide metaprogramming features, allowing you to write code that changes code on the fly. Phil digs deep into the idea that programming languages should change to reflect what we want to do and is not afraid to do the changes himself, rather than wait for Microsoft. Brain twisting? Wait til you listen to the show!
