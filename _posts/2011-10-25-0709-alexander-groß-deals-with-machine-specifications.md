Carl and Richard talk to Alexander Groß about Machine.Specification (MSpec). MSpec was initially developed by Aaron Jensen as a context/specification framework to help construct tests in a more behaviour driven development style. MSpec provides a language for describing the context and requirements of a test that business owners can read. Trying to get your head around test-first? Check out MSpec!
