Carl and Richard talk to Tomasz Janczuk about node.js. Node.js is all about building scalable network programs, typically using HTTP. Tomasz talks about how node.js can run as a standalone application that can completely replace a web server, as well as run within IIS as iisnode. iisnode is an implemenation of node.js as a native IIS module. Node.js has been around since 2009, and the community surrounding it is massive - it's only new to the .NET world. Ready to do something totally different on the web from ASP.NET?
