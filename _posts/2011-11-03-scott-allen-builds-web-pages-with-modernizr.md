Carl and Richard talk to Scott Allen about Modernizr, an open-source JavaScript library that helps you build the next generation of HTML5 and CSS3-powered websites by reporting browser features. Scott talks about how Modernizr focuses on actually testing for the availability of features on a browser, rather than just relying on the browser useragent and a browser capabilities file. Along the way there is plenty of IE6 bashing.
