Carl and Richard talk to Dan Hanan and Danny Warren about mixing Kinect together with WinRT. Back at the Build conference keynote a 'marketecture' diagram showed how existing applications still work in Windows 8 but also introduced a new platform using WinRT. At the time attendees were told that the blue side (existing applications) and the green side (WinRT) will never cross. Then the folks at Interknowlogy got to work. Dan and Danny talk about how they built an application utilizing Kinect, depending on an SDK that runs on the blue side to communicate with a Metro application that runs on the green side. Crossing the streams? You bet!
