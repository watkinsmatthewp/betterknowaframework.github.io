The first of the vignette shows from Oredev, this show focuses on web development. The first conversation is with Peter Moskovits, talking about using HTML 5 WebSockets to build real bi-directional communicating applications in the browser. The second part of the show the boys talk to Troels Thomsen about building web applications in the cloud using AppHarbor. AppHarbor focuses on making it simple to take existing ASP.NET applications into the cloud. Finally, the last conversation is with Robby Ingebretsen talking about how closely related designers and developers actually are. A great group of stories and one of many sets from Oredev!
