Next up from Oredev - the cool projects! Carl and Richard talk to the one-and-only Tess Ferrandez from Microsoft. Tess has moved on from the mad debugging skills she blogged about to focus on Kinect and Windows Phone 7. The conversation digs into using Kinect beyond XBox games. Next up, Luca Minudel discusses his experiences building software for Formula One racing, perhaps the ultimate gadget ever! Finally, the show closes with Henrik Andersson of Tobii talking about prototype eye tracking hardware built into a laptop. Tobii also makes a .NET SDK so that you can easily add eye tracking to a XAML application. These are just some of the cool projects that were talked about at Oredev!
