Carl and Richard talk to Damian Edwards and David Fowler about SignalR. SignalR is a library for providing persistant connections between a web server and a browser by providing an abstraction over top of technologies like WebSockets or even AJAX polling. SignalR requires .NET 4.0 on the back end and jQuery on the front end... although non-browser clients are in the future!
