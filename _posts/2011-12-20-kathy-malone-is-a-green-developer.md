Carl and Richard talk to Kathy Malone about green computing. Kathy, who has a day job as an environmental engineer, talks about different types of green behaviour, including turning off PCs over night, using suspend mode and the like. But for developers, there are approaches to building software that consumes fewer resources, both electrical and human energy. Is there an additional price in resources to be paid for touch computing?
