The last of the vignette shows from Oredev, this one only has two parts, but they're oddly related. The first interview is with Aaron Parecki, who talks about taking a side project that was worked on only evenings and weekends into an actual funded startup. Then an amazing conversation with Amber Case, an actual cyborg anthropologist. It's not as weird as you think, as Amber points out, any time you extend your physical or mental abilities with a peice of technology - say, a cell phone, you're a cyborg.
