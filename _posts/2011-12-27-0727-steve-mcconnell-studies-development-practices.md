Carl and Richard talk to the one-and-only Steve McConnell about the evolution of software development practices. The conversation digs into where Microsoft is at these days - Steve has been close to the company for many years. Then Steve talks about his focus on what a good software executive looks like, how they can support their team effectively and be part of the success of the development process. Along the way Steve talks about how Agile fits into his views in Code Complete, scrum practices, continuous integration and more! Great insights from one of the best minds in the business!
