Carl and Richard talk to Corey Haines about his global code retreat. But before the discussion starts on code retreats, Corey digs into his interest in teaching children software development using a tool called Scratch. The global code retreat was an event run on December 3 2011 around the world - 93 cities participated. Next year the goal is 200 cities, including a group in Antartica, and if all goes well, the space station too!
