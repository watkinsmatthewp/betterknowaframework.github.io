Carl and Richard start off 2012 remaking a show that was lost at DevConnections, talking to Jim Holmes about testing. After a quick detour to chat about the amazing CodeMash conference that Jim helps run, the conversation dives into why you want to automate your web testing. Jim talks about free tools and pay tools, including Selenium, WatiN and Telerik's Test Automation Studio. Jim mentions a ton of great tools and resources, check out the links!
