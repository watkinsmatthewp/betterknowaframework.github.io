Carl and Richard talk to the one-and-only Scott Hanselman, it's the all radio voice show! Scott starts off the conversation explaining the recent move of Scott Guthrie over to Azure - by pointing out that he hasn't moved anywhere, just added Azure to his repetiore. Then the focus goes to the MVC vs. WebForms debate, which isn't a debate at all in Scott's eyes. And then things take a turn for the worse (or is that silly) and Scott starts answering questions on twitter about his hair. Lots of laughs, but not a lot of technical content ensues thereafter.
