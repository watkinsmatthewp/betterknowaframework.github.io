Part of a group of shows recorded at DevConnections in November 2011, Carl and Richard talk to Scott Willeke about reporting technologies. The conversation explores the challenges of a widening set of data sources for reporting, including NoSQL. Scott then digs into the issues around embedding reporting solutions into your applications as opposed to web-based reporting. Reporting - love it or hate it, it never goes away!
