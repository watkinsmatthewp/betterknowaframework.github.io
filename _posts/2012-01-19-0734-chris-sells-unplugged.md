Out of Microsoft and off to Telerik, what will Chris Sells say? Chris starts out talking about his last year at Microsoft, working on Javascript in Windows 8, culminating at Build. Now Chris has moved to Telerik, focusing on building controls for the Windows 8 world that developers will love. The conversation ranges over HTML 5, XAML, XBox, Windows Phone 7, Kinect, tablets and more!
