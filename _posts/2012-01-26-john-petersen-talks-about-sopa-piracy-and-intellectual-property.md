Carl and Richard talk to John Petersen about the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). SOPA, which is now defunct, was an attempt to legislate means to stop piracy and counterfeit goods. John digs into the problems with the legislation and the misinformation surrounding it. The conversation also explores alternatives to SOPA, the Megaupload shut down and how much harm piracy is actually doing in the world.
