Carl and Richard talk to Jeremy Likness about Silverlight 5. Is Silverlight dead? Not by a long shot. Jeremy talks about the great work going on the Silverlight today and how it still is the most efficient way to build applications that run on both Windows and OSX. The conversation drills into the new features of Silverlight 5 and dispels a lot of the myths around the future of Silverlight. Jeremy also talks about Jounce, his MVVM+MEF framework on Codeplex and the relationship between Silverlight and WinRT.
