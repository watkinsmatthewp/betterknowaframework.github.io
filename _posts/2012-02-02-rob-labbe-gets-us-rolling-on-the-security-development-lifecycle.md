Carl and Richard talk to Rob Labbe about the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL). After a quick detour down the SOPA discussion, Rob fills the boys in on how the SDL maps neatly to a regular development lifecycle, just including security every step of the way. Rob also introduces the tools of the SDL, providing support for every step of the development lifecycle, from requirements to design to implementation and verification.
