Carl and Richard talk to Eric Sink about his latest work in distributed version control. Eric talks about his latest project called Veracity, an open source distributed version control system that makes it easy for widely distributed teams to share source. The conversation digs into the sometimes subtle variations between source control systems and why their users are loyal and vocal to their preferred products. Lots of digressions and explorations, along with an offer for free books - check out the links for how to get a copy!
