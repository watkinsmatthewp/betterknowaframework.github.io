Carl and Richard talk to Derick Bailey about JavaScript in general and JavaScript frameworks specifically. The conversation starts out with a discussion about the state of JavaScript in general, discussing the recent popularity of Node.js. Derick then digs into Backbone.js and how it works with jQuery to keep things far more organized. He also discusses utilizing MongoDB and RavenDB from JavaScript using JSON as the communication path. The discussion ends with some looks at the future of JavaScript in Windows 8 and the next generation of browsers.
