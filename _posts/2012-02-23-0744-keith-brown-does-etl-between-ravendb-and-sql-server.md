Carl and Richard talk to Keith Brown of Pluralsight about his work with RavenDB and SQL Server. The topic calls back to earlier conversations about the advantages of using NoSQL technology like RavenDB on the front end of an application and SQL Server on the back end for reporting. This is exactly how Pluralsight works, and Keith explains how the implementation is done.
