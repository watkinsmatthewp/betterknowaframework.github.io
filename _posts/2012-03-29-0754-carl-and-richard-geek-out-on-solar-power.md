The first of many alternative energy geek outs, Carl and Richard talk about solar power. The boys talk about using solar in the home in the form of thermal as well as photovoltaic, at utility scale with solar thermal, even space-based power. The conversation explores the huge diversity of photovoltaics, including concentrators and quantum dot technologies, the advantages and disadvantages involved. There's also a brief discussion on battery technologies, since solar power doesn't work all that well at night. In the end there aren't easy answers, but things are advancing forward - the amount of solar power being generated these days is increasing!
