Carl and Richard talk to Glenn Block about node.js on Azure. Glenn digs into how node.js has grown in popularity, and points to the Cloud9 IDE as a development environment in the Cloud as an example of a node.js application - which happens to be able to build node.js applications. And Cloud 9 can deploy node.js to Azure. The conversation digs into the Azure stack and the diversity of technologies (including node.js) that run great in the cloud.
