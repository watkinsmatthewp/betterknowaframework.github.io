Carl and Richard catch up with Ted Neward - it had been too long since he was on! The conversation starts off talking about the maturity of .NET and how unimpressed Ted is with Async and Await. Ted also talks about Javascript and Ruby and the evolution of languages as a whole. Finally, NoSQL makes an appearance with a discussion around the issues of ORM. Has Ted Neward become a grumpy old man?
