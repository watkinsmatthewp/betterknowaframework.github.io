Carl and Richard talk to Brian Noyes about the Single Page Application (SPA) feature coming in MVC 4. Brian talks about the similarities of the design patterns for SPA to the more classical Silverlight or WPF application with RIA or WCF services on the back end. While hardly new to the web space (SPAs can be traced back to Outlook Web Access circa 2002), SPAs are going to be part of Studio 11. Brian talks through the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.
