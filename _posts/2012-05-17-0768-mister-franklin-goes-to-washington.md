On Sunday, May 6th, Carl went to Washington, DC for a Fly-In at the Association for Competitive Technology (ACT) for the purpose of talking to Senators and Representatives about issues around technology. He also talked to many of the developers and IT people who were attending these meetings, some of whom are regulars on .NET Rocks! This is a very special .NET Rocks! We hope you enjoy it.
