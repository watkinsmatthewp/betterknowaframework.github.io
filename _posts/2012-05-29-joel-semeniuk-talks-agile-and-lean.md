Carl and Richard talk to Joel Semeniuk about various styles of agile development. The conversation starts with addressing a comment from a listener on dealing with decomposition of user stories so that they fit into sprints and how to manage research spikes. Joel talks about splitting time in sprints between feature building, bug fixing and research. Next the topics of lean and Kanban and how they connect together with agile development. A great refresher on agile practices!
