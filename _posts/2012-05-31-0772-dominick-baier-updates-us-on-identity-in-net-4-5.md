Carl and Richard catch up with Dominick Baier to talk about the changes to identity in the 4.5 Framework, Windows 8 and Server 2012. Dominick lets us know that claims-based security is everywhere in 4.5 - built right into the System libraries. No more separate WIF to install! The conversation also digs into the fact that Windows 8 and Server 2012 are rolling claims-based security into Active Directory, making implementation even simpler. Role-based security continues to function, but everything under the hood is a claim.
