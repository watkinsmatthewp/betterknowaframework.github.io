Carl and Richard talk to Stephen Toub about how the beta of Studio 11 has impacted parallelism. The conversation starts with a solid discussion about the difference between asynchronous, concurrency and parallelism. From there, Stephen talks about how Studio 11 has matured async and await, largely under the hood, to take advantage of more hardware and better concurrency with no additional code. He mentions the ASync Targeting Pack bringing async and await to Silverlight 5. Finally Stephen talks about some of the new instrumentation in Studio 11 to understand how parallelism is working in your application to assist with debugging and performance. Parallelism is moving forward in Studio 11!
