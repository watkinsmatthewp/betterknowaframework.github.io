At NDC Carl and Richard talk to Venkat Subramaniam about functional programming. Venkat digs into the idea that functional programming is less about language and more about practice, exploring how C# can build functional code just as well as F#. The conversation also drills into the advantages of functional programming for parallelism and the specific types of business applications that can benefit from this style of programming. Venkat's enthusiasm makes it hard to resist writing everything functional!
