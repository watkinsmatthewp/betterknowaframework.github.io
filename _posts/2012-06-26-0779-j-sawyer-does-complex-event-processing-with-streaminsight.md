Carl and Richard talk to J Sawyer about StreamInsight. Part of the SQL Server platform, StreamInsight is a stand-alone install that allows you to do complex event processing (CEP) applications. Complex Event Processing is a pattern of dealing highly parallel, high velocity data streams to do real-time analysis. J talks about how StreamInsight simplifies CEP handling all the parallelism and memory management for you. The conversation also digs into the relationship between Reactive Extensions and StreamInsight - they compliment each other. This is about taking logging to a whole new level!
