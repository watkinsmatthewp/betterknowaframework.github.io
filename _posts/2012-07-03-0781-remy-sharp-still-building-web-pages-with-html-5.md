While at NDC, Carl and Richard talk to Remy Sharp about HTML 5. Remy discusses the state of things, how the diversity of browsers is as much a strength as a problem. He digs into the idea that you need to build your web app for the audience you have - perhaps it needs more support for older browsers, or focus on the latest features for the newest browsers. Check out the great collection of links to different services and sites that Remy mentions in the discussion!
