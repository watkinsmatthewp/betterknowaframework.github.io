While at the Norwegian Developers Conference in Oslo, Carl and Richard talk to an actual Norwegian! Sondre Bjell√•s sits down with the boys to talk about building applications in Facebook. The conversation starts off with discussion about oAuth, specifically authenticating with Facebook. Sondre talks about how Facebook provides information back to you as the developer about the users that log into your web site or application - provided the user gives permission. The conversation continues into the different species of Facebook applications you can build, running inside Facebook, separately and using the social graph. A great starting point for getting into Facebook programming!
