While at NDC is Oslo, Norway, Carl and Richard talk to Hadi Hariri about MVC. Hadi talks about his experiences building MVC applications, starting with where WebForms taught some bad habits in web application construction, how some of the new Javascript libraries (like jQuery) made MVC more palatable and the performance advantages of well designed MVC. The conversation also digs into some of the mistakes novice MVC developers make, like putting far too much (and repeating) code in the controller. There's also a discussion about different data storage options as well as Hadi's position on utilizing REST.
