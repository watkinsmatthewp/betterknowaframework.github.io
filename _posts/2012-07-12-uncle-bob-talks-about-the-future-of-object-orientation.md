Carl and Richard talk to Bob Martin about where object orientation is going. Bob starts out talking about the fundamentals of where object orientation came from and how it has progressed over the years. The conversation then digs into how hardware has changed - the CPU manufacturers have stopped making faster processors and switched to making more processors. The impact of this change means developers have to write parallel executing code, something that object orientation makes difficult. Bob talks about the resurgence of functional programming as a reaction to the need for parallelism. Has object orientation run its course?
