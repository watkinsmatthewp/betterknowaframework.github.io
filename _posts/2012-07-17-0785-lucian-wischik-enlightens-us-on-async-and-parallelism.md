At NDC in Oslo, Carl and Richard talk to Lucian Wischik about using Async and Await in .NET 4 and 4.5. Lucian talks through some great scenarios of how you can use Async and Await effectively, as well as the mistakes developers can make. Method blocking and Async don't get along! The conversation also explores the differences between asynchronicity and parallelism, they aren't the same thing at all. Get ready for some awesomely lucid thinking about Async and parallelism!
