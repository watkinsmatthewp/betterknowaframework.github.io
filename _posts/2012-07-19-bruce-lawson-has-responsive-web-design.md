At NDC, Carl and Richard talk to Bruce Lawson about responsive web design. Responsive web design from Bruce's point of view is web pages that are able to adjust to the browser and device that they are being viewed on. From the huge displays on desktop PCs to the tiny screens of smartphones, you can make your web pages work effectively! Bruce talks about some of the tools and libraries available to simplify responsive web design, so check out the links from the show!
