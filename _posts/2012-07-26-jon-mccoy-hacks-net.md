Carl and Richard talk to Darth Vader, a.k.a. Jon McCoy who shows developers how to hack .NET apps in memory and on disk. This turns into a pretty dark discussion about how challenging it is to secure in depth - infiltration and exfiltration vectors, how protection tools (like anti-virus) are great mechanisms for spreading malware. And according to Jon, .NET is a great tool for hiding malicious code. He talks about how he can modify a .NET application while it is running and use it to manipulate and steal information. Not a happy show!
