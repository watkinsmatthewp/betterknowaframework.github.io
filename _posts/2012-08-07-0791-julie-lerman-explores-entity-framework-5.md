Carl and Richard chat with Julie Lerman about Entity Framework 5. EF5 ships with .NET 4.5 - yep, they broke the number synchronization this time around. Julie explains that the big number change is for a good reason - this is a big update to Entity Framework. The conversation digs into the new features, including performance improvements, enumerations and spatial datatype support. Julie also talks about a huge number of little things that are added to make EF a much more useable project. Has the magic version three happened again at Microsoft?
