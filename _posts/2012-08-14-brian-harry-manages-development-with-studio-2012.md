Carl and Richard talk to Microsoft tech fellow Brian Harry about Application Lifecycle Management with Visual Studio 2012 and Team Foundation Server. Brian digs into the thinking around the latest version of Microsoft's ALM offering, including the new tools for gathering requirements using storyboards, video, audio and annotations around applications. The conversation also digs into the core 'lather-rinse-repeat' cycle of developers getting work assignments, building and checking in their code. Then onto the amazing new features in testing and providing early look versions of applications for gathering feedback. Finally Brian talks about Team Foundation Services, TFS-in-the-Cloud so to speak, which while not directly tied to Studio 2012, does point to Microsoft's future focus for ALM. A great conversation with a guy at the center of everything ALM at Microsoft!
