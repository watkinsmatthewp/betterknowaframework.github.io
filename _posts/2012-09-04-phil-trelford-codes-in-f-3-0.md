Carl and Richard talk to Phil Trelford about the new features in F# 3.0, the version shipping with Visual Studio 2012. Phil talks about how F# is functional first, object second, as opposed to C# which is object first, functional second - but the two languages work together fine. He also digs into using F# with XAML to do UI related work. The conversation turns to projects using F# including it's role in Halo 3! F# is at its magic third version! Check out the ton of links to this show, all sorts of great stuff for getting started with F#.
