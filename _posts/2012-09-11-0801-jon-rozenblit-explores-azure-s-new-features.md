Carl and Richard talk to Jon Rozenblit about the latest set of features in Azure. The conversation starts with a discussion about Azure Mobile Services, which is really a REST storage system that doesn't need to involve mobile at all - maybe they'll fix the name! Next, with Richard's encouragement, Carl talks about his need for virtual machines and Jon digs into the features of the new virtual machine features in Azure. Jon also tackles the challenge of pricing, running on premise and how the new features in Azure make things easier for moving from on-premise to cloud and back again. Great conversation if you're ready to take a fresh look at Azure!
