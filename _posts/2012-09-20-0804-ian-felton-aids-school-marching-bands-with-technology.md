Carl and Richard talk to Ian Felton about his charity efforts. Ian talks about exercising different programming skills on different charitable projects so that he has a chance to get code into production with a lower set of demands. Ian also talks about a charity he started called Marching Mountains for getting used instruments out of closets and into the hands of students in marching bands of disadvantaged counties in Appalachia. Ian's message to us is to get involved in something you're passionate about!
