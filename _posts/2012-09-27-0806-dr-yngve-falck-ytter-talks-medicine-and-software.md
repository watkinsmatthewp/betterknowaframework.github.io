Carl and Richard talk to Dr. Yngve Falck-Ytter about his efforts to understand programming. Yngve talks about the limitations of the software in the medical industry and how he's learned to work around it with some of his own programming. Ultimately the conversation digs into the idea that good software can make treatments more effective and less expensive and, in the end, save more lives.
