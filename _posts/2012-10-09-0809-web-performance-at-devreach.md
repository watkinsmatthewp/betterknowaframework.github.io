While at DevReach, Carl and Richard hosted a panel on web performance with panelists Steve Smith, Kent Alstad and Paul Carvalho. The conversation starts with the challenge of good instrumentation, different techniques, and values for measuring performance. The panel also explores load testing, caching and other performance techniques - lots of deep dives into hard concepts!
