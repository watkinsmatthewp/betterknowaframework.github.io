While at DevReach in Bulgaria, Carl and Richard moderated a panel on architecture with panelists Steve Smith, Miguel Castro and Charles Nurse. The conversation ranged over a broad swath of architecture topics, talking about brownfield and greenfield design, different scales of architectures, the tension between developers and architects, how to do both roles at once, and more!
