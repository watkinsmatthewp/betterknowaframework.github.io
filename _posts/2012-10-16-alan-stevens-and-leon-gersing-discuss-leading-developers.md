While in Columbus, Ohio on the .NET Rocks! Visual Studio 2012 Road Trip, Carl and Richard talk to Alan Stevens and Leon Gersing about leading a group of developers in a project. Alan and Leon tell stories of how they evolved into leaders, talking about the things they did right and wrong (mostly wrong). The conversation also explores how you can grow as a leader of developers without giving up development, and how to deal with the poisonous people in your organization. Great thinking from great leaders!
