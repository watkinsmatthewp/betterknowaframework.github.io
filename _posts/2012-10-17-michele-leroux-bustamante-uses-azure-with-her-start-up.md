While at the Toronto stop of the .NET Rocks! Visual Studio Launch Road Trip, Carl and Richard talked to Michele Leroux Bustamante about her experiences running a start-up using Azure. Michele talks about how she's been able to bootstrap her startup company SnapBoard with no external funding. The conversation digs into how you can get free Azure services using MSDN, BizSpark and BizSpark Plus, as well as the process of doing a lean start up - don't build more than you have to and get as much feedback as you can!
