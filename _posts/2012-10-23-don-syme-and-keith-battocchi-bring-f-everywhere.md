While at the Boston stop of the .NET Rocks! Visual Studio 2012 Launch Road Trip, Carl and Richard talk to Don Syme and Keith Battocchi about F# 3.0. Don and Keith talk about their roles in building F#, still being part of Microsoft Research and working with Microsoft's Developer Division in Redmond. The conversation also digs into F#'s ability to create type providers for accessing internal and external data as if it is part of the language. Call it the ultimate extension to IntelliSense!
