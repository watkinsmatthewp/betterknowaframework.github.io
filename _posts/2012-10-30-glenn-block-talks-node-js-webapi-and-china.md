While at the Philly stop of the .NET Rocks! Visual Studio 2012 Launch Road Trip, Carl and Richard talk to Glenn Block about Node.js, WebAPI and China. The conversation digs into the philosophical differences of Node, JavaScript outside the browser, and starting from a blank slate of services, rather than the 'everything-on' model of yester-year. Glenn also talks about his experiences in China, engaging the local development community in Shanghai, and the tools and preferences there.
