While at the Louisville stop of the .NET Rocks! Visual Studio Launch Road Trip, Carl and Richard sat down with Alex Robson to dig deep on what it takes to be a successful polyglot programmer. Alex talks about the characteristics of different languages - not just their syntax, but also their idioms and culture, and how that affects their role in building software. He talks specifically about C#, Javascript (largely in the form of node.js) and Erlang.
