On the .NET Rocks! Visual Studio 2012 Launch Road Trip, Carl and Richard stopped in at the NoVa Code Camp in Reston, Virginia and talked to Oren Eini about the role of NoSQL in modern application development. Oren explores the compromises that developers make to work with relational databases - compromises that are made by reflex, with almost no thought. He makes the case that in many cases, building applications that store data in NoSQL stores (including RavenDB) are simpler, more reliable and faster to develop. So what is the role of SQL Server in this new world? Listen to find out!
