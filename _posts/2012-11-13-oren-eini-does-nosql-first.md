On the .NET Rocks! Visual Studio 2012 Launch Road Trip, Carl and Richard stopped in at the NoVa Code Camp in Reston, Virginia and talked to Oren Eini about the role of NoSQL in modern application development. Oren explores the compromises that developers make to work with relational databases - compromises that are made by reflex, with almost no thought.
