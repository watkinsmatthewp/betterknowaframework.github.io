While at the Better Software show in Orlando during the Road Trip, Carl and Richard talked to Dan North about how development teams can manage uncertainty. Dan talks about how software planning can change to being more discovery based, knowing what is unknown. That process gets people talking and learning from each other and ultimately creates excellent plans.
