While on the .NET Rocks! Visual Studio 2012 Launch Road Trip stop in Orlando Florida, Carl and Richard stopped into the Better Software conference and interviewed Scott Ambler about his work helping companies implement agile development practices. The conversation starts out talking about the scalability of agile practices, how waterfall is hard to get rid of, and common mistakes that organizations make implementing agile. Scott also digs into the DevOps movement, talking about how all stakeholders in an application, including operations and tech support, need to be part of the process.
