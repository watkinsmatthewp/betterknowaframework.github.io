At the Jacksonville stop of the .NET Rocks! Visual Studio 2012 Launch Road Trip, Carl and Richard sat down with former co-host of .NET Rocks! Mark Dunn to talk about his experiences with MVC. The conversation starts out talking about the old days - when Carl and Mark both taught .NET. Mark has continued to train, but these days focuses on MVC. He compares the modern web application approach of MVC with the old days, talks about strengths and weakenesses and how you can get the most out of your web application.
