While at the Los Angeles stop of the .NET Rocks! Visual Studio 2012 Launch Road Trip, Carl and Richard sat down with Phil Haack to talk about Git and GitHub. The conversation starts out with a primer on Git itself and its origins as a distributed source control for Linux. Then Phil discusses how GitHub created a more social environment for Git with pull requests and dialog around code. Phil also talks about how GitHub itself operates as a non-hierarchical business and what that means to his work day, his career and his prospects for a raise. A little NuGet sneaks in there too!
