At the San Francisco stop of the .NET Rocks! Visual Studio 2012 Road Trip, Carl and Richard sat down with Ward Bell in the GitHub offices to talk about his experiences creating breeze.js. Breeze.js focuses on the plumbing needed to make Single Page Applications (SPA) on the web work well. Ward talks about key pieces of Breeze including caching, validation, automated object mapping and more. He admits his inspiration is Silverlight and how it handled this plumbing so well. Now it's available in Javascript as well!
