The first geek out of 2013, Carl and Richard talk about nuclear power. Much feared and maligned, Richard walks through the principles of atomic theory, how neutrons are the key to the whole process and why Uranium-235 is so much more important than Uranium-238. The conversation also dives into some alternative nuclear power concepts including Traveling Wave Reactors, Pebble Bed Reactors and Thorium Salt Reactors. But they steer clear of fusion - that's another show!
