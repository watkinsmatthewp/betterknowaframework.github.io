Carl and Richard talk to Andrew Brust about Big Data. Andrew starts off connecting together the definitions of business intelligence, data analytics, OLAP, data warehousing and big data. They're all related, even though they've come at the problem of understanding data from different directions. The conversation digs deeply into Hadoop, the Linux-centric MapReduce technology that has come to define the idea of Big Data, as well as Microsoft's implementation once called Project Isotope and now known as HDInsight. How big is Big Data? That's up to you!
