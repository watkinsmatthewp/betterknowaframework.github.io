While at CodeMash, Carl and Richard collected some great stories. First up is Evan Hauck, who digs into CUDAfy, a library on Codeplex that allows you to run C# code (any IL code actually) on your GPU. The second story is about Jessie Shternshus and her company The Improv Effect. Jessie talks about how she uses improv to help teams work together more effectively. Another awesome CodeMash!
