Carl and Richard talk to Martin Woodward about Microsoft's announcement of integrating Git into Visual Studio and TFS. Martin talks about Microsoft's thinking about why and how to add Git support to Visual Studio and TFS. Then the conversation digs into the different configuration options - the Git tools work even in Visual Studio Express! Martin compares the differences of using Git directly from Studio as well as via TFS. It's a cool time to be a Studio programmer!
