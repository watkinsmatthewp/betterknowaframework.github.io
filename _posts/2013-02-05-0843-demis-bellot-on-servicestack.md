Carl and Richard talk to Demis Bellot about ServiceStack, a set of tools for building web services and MVC web sites with incredible performance. Demis talks about his thinking behind ServiceStack, its support for a diverse set of protocols and how it compares to WCF and WebAPI. The conversation also dives into Google's Protocol Buffers, an extremely lean protocol even faster than JSON for web services as well as Dart, Google's optionally typed, higher-level language that transpiles to Javascript. Awesome conversation with a hugely smart guy!
