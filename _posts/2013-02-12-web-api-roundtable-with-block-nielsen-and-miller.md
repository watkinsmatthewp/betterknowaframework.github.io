Carl and Richard host a now-rare telephone-based conference call (remember when these were cool?) with Glenn Block, Henrik Nielsen and Darrel Miller about Web API. But first the conversation has to deal with the reality of having Henrik Nielsen on the call - a former graduate student of Tim Berners Lee and a guy who worked on the very beginnings of the World Wide Web!
