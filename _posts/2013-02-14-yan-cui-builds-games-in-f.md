Carl and Richard talk to Yan Cui about his experience building games with F#. Yan talks about his experiences working with games through Facebook, the client side being predominantly Flash, but the back end systems being initially Java, then converted to C#, and now to F#. As Yan explains, F# is faster, smaller, easier to maintain and to read. The conversation spans over dealing with parallelism, massive scale, cloud implementation and data analytics as well - lots of cool stuff!
