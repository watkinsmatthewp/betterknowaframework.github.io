At the MVP Summit, Carl and Richard talk to Steve Smith about the Software Craftmanship calendar. While filled with good messages like Separating Concerns and YAGNI, it also has hilarious images of why you should follow these principles. The conversation digs into each of the topics with different ideas and approaches to being successful. A fun Thursday show!
