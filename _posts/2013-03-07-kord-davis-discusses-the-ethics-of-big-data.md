Carl and Richard talk to Kord Davis about the ethics of Big Data. As developers we tend to focus on the technology, rather than the impact it has - and big data gets into some serious moral hazards. Kord talks about some of the issues that companies have gotten into around Big Data, deriving facts about individuals that they have intended to keep private. Legislation is coming around Big Data - be part of that conversation.
