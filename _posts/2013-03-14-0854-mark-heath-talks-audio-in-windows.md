Carl and Richard talk to Mark Heath about audio in Windows. Mark is the leader on the nAudio codeplex project that is a .NET audio and MIDI library. The conversation digs into the fundamentals of digital audio as well as many of the codex and APIs associated with audio - it can be confusing! Mark also talks a bit about the history of audio gear around AdLib, Soundblaster, Voyetra and the like. Mark has some other open source projects involving audio including a Skype voice changer and MP3 decoder in managed code. Check 'em out!
