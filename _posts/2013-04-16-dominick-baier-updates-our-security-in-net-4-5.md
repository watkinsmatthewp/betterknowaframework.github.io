Dominick Baier returns to talk to Carl and Richard about the current state of security in .NET 4.5.

The conversation then digs into the challenges around OAuth 2 and the challenges of building specifications by committee when you're dealing with security. Also listen for a great dig into the real goals of identity technologies that largely haven't come to pass yet - there's still a ways to go!
