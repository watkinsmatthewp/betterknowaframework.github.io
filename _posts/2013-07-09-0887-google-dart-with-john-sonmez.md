Carl and Richard talk to John Sonmez about Google DART. DART is Google's alternative to JavaScript (although it also compiles to JavaScript) to make building web applications more reliable, scalable and maintainable. Imagine all the good stuff of all your favorite languages in one place! John talks about how DART can compile into JavaScript for non-DART browsers, but runs natively at about ten times the speed of JavaScript. Although the only native browser is Dartium and is pre-beta, some day DART will show up in your regular browser!
