Carl and Richard chat with legendary Mark Minasi of Mastering Windows fame. While Mark largely focuses on the IT side of Windows, this conversation digs into the topics that developers will find especially interesting. Mark talks about the good and bad of Windows 8, how PowerShell is an awesome tool for IT Pro and an even more awesome tool for developers! The line between the roles has blurred! There's also a brief discussion about side-loading Windows 8 applications, it's still harder than it needs to be. It's not just about goodness of Windows 8, it's about the reality of what is hard and easy.
