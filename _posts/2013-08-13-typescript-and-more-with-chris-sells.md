Carl and Richard talk to Chris Sells about his experimentation with TypeScript. The conversation starts out with a discussion about the pervasiveness of C# and how the Mono Project brought .NET to a wider audience than just Windows. From there, Chris talks about a variety of languages beyond JavaScript, including TypeScript and others (check out the links). Ultimately the conversation circles back to JavaScript and mobile development, talking about the use of WinJS and the Cordova-derived web-based development solutions including Telerik's Icenium. Great thoughts from one of the best in the industry! Don't forget to activate your MSDN Azure account and be automatically entered to win an Aston Martin V8 Vantage!
