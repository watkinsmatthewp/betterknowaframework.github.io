Carl and Richard talk to Russ Unger about his work in wireframing user experiences. The conversation starts out talking about the differences between wireframing and prototyping, as well as the role of design in modern applications. And the occasional mention of the deprecated BLINK tag. Russ talks about a design effort between himself and three friends, each using different tools to design the same application. The results are a surprise! Make sure you activate your Windows Azure credits in your MSDN Subscription! You could win an Aston Martin!
