Carl and Richard talk to Eric Boyd about what the power of Netflix Chaos Monkey can do to your cloud application. The conversation digs into the thinking around deep testing for highly available systems - it's not what you think of, it's what you never thought about! Eric digs into the thinking around testing in production (what happens when you're too big to test?) and how the various part of the SimianArmy, including Chaos Monkey, are byproducts of very large scale applications in the cloud. You don't choose Chaos Monkey, Chaos Monkey chooses you! Make sure you activate your Windows Azure credits in your MSDN Subscription! You could win an Aston Martin!
