Carl and Richard talk to Matthew Podwysocki about the latest news around Reactive Extensions. Matthew starts out talking about how Reactive Extensions has moved into open source in a big way, with lots of cross platform support - .NET, JavaScript, C++, Ruby, Python, even Java itself! The conversation digs into the thinking around the reactive approach to development, dealing with massive streams of data and tying event trapping over it. Lots of great thinking about modern development concepts! Make sure you activate your Windows Azure credits in your MSDN Subscription! You could win an Aston Martin!
