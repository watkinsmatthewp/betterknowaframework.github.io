Carl and Richard geek out on asteroid mining - the goal that could change mankind forever! After an initial conversation about the problems with sending humans to Mars (in a word: RADIATION), the topic turns to asteroid mining and those crazy folks at Planetary Resources. Richard attacks the idea of justifying asteroid mining with high value minerals and digs into the cooler idea - manufacturing in space. Once you solve the problems of prospecting, extraction and refining resources in space, you can start assembling into things! What do spacecraft and satellites look like if you don't care about lifting them from the Earth! Lots of fun thinking here!
