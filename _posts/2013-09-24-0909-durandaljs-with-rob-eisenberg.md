Carl and Richard talk to Rob Eisenberg about DurandalJS. DurandalJS is a library for facilitating building Single Page Applications (SPAs). It works along side jQuery, Knockout and RequireJS as well as CSS libraries like Bootstrap and Foundation. Rob talks about how DurandalJS came to be as a logical path from his MVVM framework, Caliburn.Micro. Much discussion about interoperating with other libraries like RequireJS, jQuery, Knockout as well as comparisons with Angular and Ember. Rob builds great things!
