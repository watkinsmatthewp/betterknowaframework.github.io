Carl and Richard talk to the one-and-only Kim Tripp about physical database design - and why it's still important. The conversation starts out talking about the state of SQL Server today, its maturity and how it works well enough that it's often ignored until there are problems. Kim talks about a 30-day blog series written by the SQLSkills team about being an accidental DBA - you didn't want to take care of a SQL Server, you just are! Always fun to talk to Kim!
