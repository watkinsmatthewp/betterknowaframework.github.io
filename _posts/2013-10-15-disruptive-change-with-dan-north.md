While on the .NET Rocks NDC UK Tour, Carl and Richard stopped in London to talk to the one and only Dan North. Dan discussed his latest projects, changing the way large organizations (like Bank of America!) do development, making work more fun, more creative and more efficient at the same time. Disruptive change? You bet! Disruptive change for the better!
