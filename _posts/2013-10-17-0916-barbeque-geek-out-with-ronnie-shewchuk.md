Carl and Richard talk to Rockin' Ronnie Shewchuk about making barbeque - real barbeque, the low heat, slow cooking approach that turns tough hunks of meat into yummy goodness. The conversation starts out talking about the different regions of barbeque, like Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and more! Ronnie also talks about different cooking systems - smokers, grills, charcoal, wood, and more! Barbeque is chemistry, delicious, delicious chemistry - you need to do this!
