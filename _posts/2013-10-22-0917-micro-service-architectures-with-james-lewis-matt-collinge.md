While at the Manchester stop of the UK Road Trip, Carl and Richard talked to James Lewis and Matt Collinge about micro service architectures. James served as a consultant from ThoughtWorks to comparethemarket.com where Matt is the lead architect. The conversation started out talking about the challenges that comparethemarket.com had with it's architecture a few years ago - an all too familiar problem of every new feature making the core applications less scalable, less stable and harder to maintain. James and Matt then dig into the process that comparethemarket.com went through to redesign the applications using micro services to simplify and strengthen the applications over time. Great architectural discussion!
