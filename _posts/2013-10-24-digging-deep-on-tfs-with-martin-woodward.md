While at the Belfast stop of the .NET Rocks Ireland Road Trip, Carl and Richard talked to the one-and-only Martin Woodward! Martin discusses the state of Team Foundation Server today and source control in general. The conversation ranges over the evolution of source control, the effects of the internet on creating distributed version control and how Git, SVC, HG and many other version control systems all get along. Great thinking from a guy who's spent years deeply immersed in source control!
