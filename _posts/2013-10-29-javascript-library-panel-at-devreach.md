While at DevReach in Sofia, Bulgaria, Carl and Richard moderated a panel on Javascript libraries with Phil Japikse, Dan Wahlin and Justin Searls. The conversation starts out exploring the panelists' favorite libraries and combinations of libraries hereafter referred to as 'tribes.' Lots of discussion on Single Page Applications, mobile web and library management.
