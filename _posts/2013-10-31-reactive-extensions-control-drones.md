Carl and Richard talk to Einar Høst, Jonas Winje and Bjørn Einar Bjartnes about their experiences using Reactive Extensions to control an AR Parrot Drone. The conversation starts out with a discussion on the fundamentals of reactive extensions, the idea of raising events around streams of data, and how that applies to something physical like a drone. Quickly, the core issue becomes time - we think about computing as instantaneous, and real life takes longer than that! A very geeky discussion about a cool way to program in real life.
