Carl and Richard chat with Matt Wynne about Cucumber, a tool for building requirement statements that are actually testable in your development environment. Matt starts out with a discussion about behavior driven development and how Cucumber evolved as a way to not only capture behaviors effectively but to actually make them part of the testing process using a language called Gerkin (and yeah, the whole show is full of pickle references). Matt also talks about SpecFlow, which is Cucumber for .NET and talks about all the different flavors of Cucumber out in the world. This naturally leads to a discussion about the state of Ruby since Cucumber started there. Great thoughts about how technologies evolve by branching and merging ideas!
