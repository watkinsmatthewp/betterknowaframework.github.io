Carl and Richard chat with Mark Greenway about his work using MongoDB on Azure. The conversation starts out talking about fundamentals - why NoSQL? From there, Mark talks about his web based application, running as an Azure web site, that started out using SQL Azure, until he ran across MongoDB. Now his application uses both, but in the future, he sees it all as MongoDB. NoSQL in the cloud!
