While at Øredev in Malmö, Sweden, Carl and Richard talk to Rachel Reese about her fun with F#. Rachel's background in mathematics led her to experiment with functional languages like Erlang and F#, and ultimately to solve problems more effectively utilizing techniques like parallelism from F#. The conversation also explores the actor model (and agents, and a bunch of other Hollywood terms) as well as the cool new type providers that are in F# 3.0. Another huge F# fan - have you taken it out for a spin yet?
