A rockstar geek out at Øredev in Malmö, Sweden! Carl and Richard chat with Randall Munroe of XKCD fame! Randall talks about how he left NASA to focus on drawing web comics (?!) and the fun that has ensued since. The conversation digs into a bunch of the thinking of various XKCD comics.  If you're a fan, you're in for a treat, and if you're not, you need to get reading!
