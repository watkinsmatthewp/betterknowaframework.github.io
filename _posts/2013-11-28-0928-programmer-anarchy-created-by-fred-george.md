While at Øredev in Malmö, Sweden, Carl and Richard talk to Fred George about implementing programmer anarchy in your organization. This is the good form of anarchy - the kind that focuses on self-organization, rather than blowing things up. Fred talks about the roles of management in software, and which ones make sense and which one don't... and how developers can take over those roles in conjunction with development. Autonomy and mastery, that's what keeps developers motivated!
