While at Øredev in Malmö, Sweden, Carl and Richard talk to Scott Barber about testing for performance and in production. Scott discusses his history that leads him to getting involved in making systems more efficient - sometimes that means faster, sometimes it means something else! The conversation digs into the essence of meaningful testing - having a team that has each other's backs when it comes to delivering good quality software. Great thinking about testing, performance and DevOps.
