The day before the US Road Trip started in Boston, Carl and Richard sat down with Bill Wagner to talk about the latest version of TypeScript. But first Bill talked about Humanitarian Toolbox, a charity building open source software for disaster relief organizations that he and Richard are deeply involved in. Then the conversation turned to TypeScript, a language for bringing types, classes and modules to Javascript. Originally a separate installation off of GitHub, TypeScript is part of Visual Studio 2013. Bill talks about the challenges of building maintainable Javascript and how TypeScript makes things better!
