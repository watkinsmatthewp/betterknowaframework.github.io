While at the Atlanta stop of the ModernApps2013 Road Trip, Carl and Richard talked to Joel Semeniuk about the latest on TFS 2013. Joel talks about how TFS 2013 changes your thinking about source control, requirements planning, work tracking and more. Great conversation about what it means to do 21st century application building!
