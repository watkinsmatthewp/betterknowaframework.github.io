While at Øredev in Malmö, Sweden, Carl and Richard talk to Björn Granvik about being a lifetime learner. The conversation starts out with a history lesson about Øredev - Björn has been involved since the beginning. He talks about how the development firm he was involved with tried to improve learning with their developers... which ultimately led to creating a conference! Björn talks about understanding how you learn for yourself, and making time to continuously improve.
