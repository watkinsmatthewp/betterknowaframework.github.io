While at NDC-London, Carl and Richard talk to Steve Sanderson about his work with KnockoutJS, Azure and other goodies. Steve starts out talking about his role in Knockout and the MVVM pattern as well as his work building the admin consoles for Azure. The conversation then dives into Steve's latest project, using WebGL to take advantage of GPU processing inside a browser! Along the way the boys talk about the effects of plugins on browsing for mortals and some thoughts on what web apps will look like in the future.
