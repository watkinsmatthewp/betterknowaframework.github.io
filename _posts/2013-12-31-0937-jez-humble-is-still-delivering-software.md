While at NDC-London, Carl and Richard talk to Jez Humble about his latest thoughts on continuous delivery. Jez talks about the tendency of people to count on tools to provide continuous delivery, while culture and process are far more important components. No technology will save you from bad practices and a lack of trust! The conversation also digs into the inertia of automation, resistance to change, and the disconnect within a team on intention, risk tolerance and reward! It all starts with talking to your people!
