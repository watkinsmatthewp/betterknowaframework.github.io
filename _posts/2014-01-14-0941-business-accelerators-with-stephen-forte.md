While in Chicago at the ModernApps2013 Tour, Carl and Richard talk to Stephen Forte about accelerators - startup business accelerators. Stephen discusses how small teams enter into accelerators to learn about building Minimal Viable Products and the fundamentals of lean startups. The cornerstone of this story is Erik Reis' Lean Startup book. The conversation also dives into crowdsourcing sites like kickstarter and indiegogo.
