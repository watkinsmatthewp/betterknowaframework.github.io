At the beginning of the west coast leg of the ModernApps2013 road trip, Carl and Richard talk to Julie Lerman about the latest features of Entity Framework in Visual Studio 2013. Julie talks about the improvements made in EF6, the version of Entity Framework that ships 'alongside' Visual Studio 2013. The focus is on code-first data interaction, but along the way Richard puts on his DBA app and complains. The conversation digs into performance, tuning and creating maintainable data that works well with EF. And most importantly, Julie discusses how Entity Framework is now entirely open source and on CodePlex! More great thoughts from Julie!
