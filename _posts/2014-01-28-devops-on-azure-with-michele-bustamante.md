During the Seattle stop of the ModernApps2013 road trip, Carl and Richard chatted with Michele Leroux Bustamante about her experiences with Azure, and how that naturally leads to some DevOps practices. Michele discusses the relative benefits of automation over manual control, dealing with the challenges of account privileges, and why startups seem to be so much better at DevOps than bigger organizations.
