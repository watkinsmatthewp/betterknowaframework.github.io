Carl and Richard talk to Hilton Giesenow down in South Africa about what it takes to build real enterprise-class SharePoint systems. Hilton talks about the history of SharePoint and how it's twists-and-turns have left a bad taste in the mouth of some developers. The conversation also digs into the infrastructure side, which is unavoidable when it comes to SharePoint - there are lots of moving parts, and someone has to take charge of them. If you're keen on SharePoint, you owe it to yourself to have a listen to Hilton's own podcast, The Moss Show!
