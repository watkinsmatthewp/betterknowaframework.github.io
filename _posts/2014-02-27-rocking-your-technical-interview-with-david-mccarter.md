Carl and Richard chat with David McCarter about what it takes to be successful when you are interviewed for a job. But David goes well beyond just the interview - are you pursuing the right job for you? Are you looking for it the right way?

What are the right answers to classic questions like 'do you have any questions for us?' And check out the link below for David's video on the subject.
