Carl and Richard chat with Christian Weyer about his experiences working with cloud technologies in Germany. The conversation starts out pretty grim, digging into how the NSA revelations have chilled interest in cloud technology because of security and privacy concerns. Christian talks about how the technology of Azure is more compelling than ever, but customers just aren't willing to use it. This leads to a conversation about Windows Azure Pack for Windows Server, which brings many Azure technologies to your own internal networks. There's a number of different ways to use Windows Azure Pack, including as a self-service portal to provide testing infrastructure for developers - talk to your ops folks and try it out!
