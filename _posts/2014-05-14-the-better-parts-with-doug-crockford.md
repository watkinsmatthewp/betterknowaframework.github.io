While at DevIntersection in Orlando, Florida, Carl and Richard chat with Douglas Crockford about the better parts of JavaScript. Douglas wrote JavaScript the Good Parts back in 2008 and was a key influencer in making JavaScript the important language it has become. The conversation digs into the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript and how it is evolving. Douglas also talks a bit about JSON and the wonders of not recreating the wheel. Great thinking from one of the important minds of the Web today!
