Carl and Richard chat with SharePoint legend Ted Pattison about his experiences with the latest version of SharePoint. Microsoft is pushing hard to make SharePoint a service that you pay by the month for - but is that what customers actually want? Ted discusses his customer's ongoing focus with on-premise SharePoint, how development models are evolving, and the best opportunities for developers going forward. Ted sees SharePoint changing significantly in the next few years - both users and developers will be impacted.
