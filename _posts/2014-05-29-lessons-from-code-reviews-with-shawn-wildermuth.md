Carl and Richard talk to Shawn Wildermuth about his experiences in code reviews - what good and bad reviews look like and what he's learned reviewing lots of different projects. Shawn runs down the challenges of team dynamics when it comes to code reviews, how some folks don't dare show their code, and how to get past those types of hurdles. Then the conversation turns to the brass tacks - common problems, different styles of coding, and so on. The more code you look at, the more you learn!
