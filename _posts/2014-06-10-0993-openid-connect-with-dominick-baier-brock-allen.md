While at NDC in Oslo, Carl and Richard chat with Dominick Baier and Brock Allen about their latest thinking on consumer and enterprise identity solutions. Dominick talks about the conflict between WS-Federation, the confusion that is OAuth2 and how OpenID-Connect is bringing them together in a better solution. Brock digs into how a centralized security service simplifies coding for developers as well as strengthening the overall security of the system. Overall, the news is good - granular authentication and authorization is getting easier to implement, deploy and manage.
