While at NDC, Carl and Richard chat with Cory House about his experiences building Single Page Applications for the automotive industry. Cory talks about the challenges of the industry, including supporting both IE7 and IE8 running on Windows XP and iPad devices. Quite a span of technology there! The conversation digs into UI design, the integration of third party services and meeting the expectations of a customer that is not all that focused on technology. Cory digs into the idea of SPA as a classic desktop application replacement - it can be done!
