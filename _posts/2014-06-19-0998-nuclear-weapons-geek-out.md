Well here we go - a tough geek out topic if ever there was one. The most requested Geek Out we haven't done yet: nuclear weapons! Starting back before World War II, Richard digs into the science history that created the first proposals for nuclear weapons. The war ultimately provided the catalyst in the form of the Manhattan Project, culminating in the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Then the story continues into thermonuclear weapons and other variations. What defense is there against nukes? And what about non-proliferation and arms reductions treaties? How safe is the world today from nukes?
