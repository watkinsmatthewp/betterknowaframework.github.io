Carl and Richard talk to Stephen Forte about the continuing evolution of wearables and their role in the workplace. The conversation starts out focused on the most visible of the wearables today - Google Glass. Does it have a role in the enterprise? That's a tricky concept. Steve talks about retail and more industrial applications, places where workers in motion get additional contextual information to improve their work. Human instrumentation is a big part of the wearable market as well, like FitBit. Steve talks about making sure workers move enough - not sitting too long, not walking too far, and so on. And there's more instrumentation to talk about, check out the links in the show notes!
