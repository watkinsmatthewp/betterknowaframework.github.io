Celebrate the millennium with us in this special episode of .NET Rocks! We do a little looking back, a little looking around and a little looking forward. Jason Olson joins us for a mini-show about audio and MIDI in Windows - and an epic giveaway. Mary Jo Foley shares her story of how the world is a better place because of .NET Rocks!, as do you, our listeners! You told us your stories of success, and now it's your turn to shine.
