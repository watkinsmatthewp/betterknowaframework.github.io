While at NDC, Carl and Richard chat with Troy Hunt about specific common web security breaches and things you can do about them. The conversation starts out with a continuation of an earlier show, talking about the vulnerabilities around open WiFi connections. From there, Troy talks about the most common breach of them all - SQL Injection. Yes, it's still a problem. Troy also digs into the importance of transport layer security, typically using SSL. There's a reason all the big web sites have switched to HTTPS all of the time. Maybe it's something you should consider also?
