In what is likely to become a multi-part series, Richard and Carl chat about fusion power, focused on the "hot" side of fusion - megaprojects like the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). But first, a review of what is actually involved in fusing atoms together and how it differs from fission (as discussed in the older nuclear power shows. Richard then delves into a quick history lesson of power demand and why we need fusion as well as the stories of the first nuclear fusion projects before hitting the big time: NIF and ITER. Do they work? Will they work? Does it make sense? What is the impact of Big Science (tm) on getting science actually done?
