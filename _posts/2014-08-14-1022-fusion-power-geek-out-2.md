Well, here we go - the second installation of the fusion power geek out. While the first show focused on the "Big Science" fusion power projects like NIF and ITER, this time around Richard digs into smaller hybrid projects, like General Fusions Magnetized Target Fusion as well as Colliding Beam Fusion Reactors being built by Helion Energy and Tri Alpha Energy. These fusion approaches combine magnetic and inertial plasma confinement to make fusion a little less extreme and more manageable - with more focus on how to actually make electricity. Also, they seem to be funded by tech billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Paul Allen. Is that a good thing or bad? Is this stuff all snake oil? There's more to talk about!
