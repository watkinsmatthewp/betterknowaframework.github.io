Carl and Richard talk to Daniel Piessens about building continuous delivery solutions. The conversation starts out with an explanation of the differences between continuous integration, deployment, and delivery - and the fact that there are business decisions to deal with there, not just technical decisions! Daniel also digs into the challenges around getting Operations deeply involved in the testing process so that they have control over features as they are developed and can be turned off and on of your canary servers when needed. Lots of cool thinking about the future of software development with DevOps practices.
