Carl and Richard talk to GitHub denizen and former Microsoftie Phil Haack about what it means to build open source software. The conversation starts off with a reminder that back in Phil's Microsoft days, he was a huge advocate of taking various Microsoft products open source - and today it's actually happening! Phil may have moved on to GitHub, but the spirit of open source has permeated the web team at Microsoft, the ultimate manifestation being ASP.NET vNext! So what about your projects? What does it takes to make them open source, and what benefits can you expect?
