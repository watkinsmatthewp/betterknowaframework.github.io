Carl and Richard chat with Robert Bogue about the adventure that is requirements gathering. The conversation starts out with a sharing of war stories, talking about finding the right people to talk to in order to understand the overall application requirements in general, much less individual specifications. Robert talks a bit about a variety of techniques for requirements gathering, referencing some of the Agile Manifesto in the process, but recognizing that requirements themselves are largely methodology independent - it just takes relentless investigation and a goal of thoroughly understanding the system.
