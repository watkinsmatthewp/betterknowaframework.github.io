Carl and Richard talk to Jimmy Bogard about his experiences scaling an MVC web site to thousands of pages and thousands of users. The conversation starts out focused on why to use MVC - comparing original ASP with ASP.NET Web Forms and MVC. Jimmy talks about the early days of MVC and the challenges of making a very new product work, but in exchange for some substantial benefits - but perhaps not the ones you'd think! Jimmy also digs into scaling an MVC web site across multiple servers, dealing with state management (Session is evil!) and what you can do to web pages to keep them performing well with large numbers of users. The discussion also moves to managing huge number of pages and developing patterns for UI and object naming to simplify development and testing. Automation is key when you're working at scale!
