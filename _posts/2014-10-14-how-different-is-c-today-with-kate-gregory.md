Kate Gregory is back! Carl and Richard chat with Kate about the state of C++ today. The conversation starts out with a discussion about the recent C++ conference in Redmond that brought the best-and-brightest in the industry together to talk about how C++ is currently being used and how the standards can continue to evolve. Kate talks about the challenges of the language, how it is not typically used for CRUD apps, but rather applications that live on rovers on Mars, in games, in drivers, operating systems and a whole host of diverse platforms. That's what makes C++ amazing, it's everywhere! The discussion continues on how C++ does continue to evolve, adapt the best ideas from other language (looking at you, lambdas!) and today's code is dramatically different from just a few years ago. Check it out!
