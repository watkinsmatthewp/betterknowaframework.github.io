While at the NSBConf in Brooklyn, Carl and Richard talk to Oren Eini about the latest version of RavenDB. Oren talks about the huge number of changes that have happened in version 3 of RavenDB - it's come a long way from a little transactional document store of years ago! The conversation digs into how the feature set was developed; Oren talks about digging into various customer projects to see how they have pushed his product in ways he had never considered before. The discussion also digs into other document stores, including Microsoft's recently announced Azure DocumentDB - and Oren is not that impressed, but it *is* a preview after all. Oren also talks about his views on MongoDB and what its strengths and weaknesses are. There are lots of different ways to store data, and you can pick the one that is right for you... there is no one way to do it!
