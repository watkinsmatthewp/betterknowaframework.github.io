John Sonmez is back - and talking about your career! Carl and Richard chat with John about his latest book, Soft Skills. The conversation starts out with a list of books that have been influential in thinking about how you work with others. John talks about putting energy into the leadership of your career, not just managing it - where do you want to go? It's easy to get bogged down in the day-to-day, but having a bigger goal makes it easier to get up and get to work!
