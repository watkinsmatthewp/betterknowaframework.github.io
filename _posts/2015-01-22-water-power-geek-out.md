One more alternative energy Geek Out - generating power with water! The conversation starts with hydroelectric power, but then moves to tidal and wave power. Some work, some don't, and it's not just about the technology either, how the business models are built matter a lot. But there's a lot of energy from wave and tides to be had, the trick is knowing how to capture it! From tidal barrages to underwater turbines, buoys, snakes and air turbines, there are a lot of approaches to capturing this massive power resource.
