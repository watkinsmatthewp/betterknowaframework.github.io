Still resisting going to WPF? Billy is here to help! Carl and Richard chat with Billy Hollis about the ever-improving ability of WPF to build great looking desktop applications. Billy talks about techniques for getting the most from WPF and paths for new developers to take to be successful. There's a huge array of options out there in WPF, it can be terribly confusing to know where to get started. WPF is eight years old - as old as Visual Basic ever got! Shouldn't everyone be using it by now?
