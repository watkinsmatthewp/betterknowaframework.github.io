ASP.NET continues to evolve! Carl and Richard talk to Mads Kristensen about the many amazing things he's working on in the web space, starting with Web Essentials! Mads explains how Web Essentials is a way to experiment with new features for ASP.NET, and that success comes when the feature is pulled into Visual Studio itself - and you get to be part of that process, it's all open source! The conversation turns to Visual Studio embracing the web development ecosystem to use the best tools for the job, whether that is browser and performance testing, package management and workflow. Use whatever tools you want from whomever, and Visual Studio will work with them - 2015 is shaping up to be an amazing version!
