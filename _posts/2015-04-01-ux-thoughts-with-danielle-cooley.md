How are you thinking about UX these days? Carl and Richard chat with Danielle Cooley about her talk at the Nebraska Code Camp around user experience, efficiency and effectiveness of design. Danielle talks about her background in biotechnical design and the challenges of bringing biology (that's us) and technology together in an effective way - including web design! The conversation explores a variety of effective designs: it's not just about speed and simplicity, sometimes it's more important to make things discoverable and clear! Danielle focuses on user-oriented design and how developers can decrease confusion, increase satisfaction and generally make the world a better place. Lots of great tips and thoughts from someone who works on the problem every day!
