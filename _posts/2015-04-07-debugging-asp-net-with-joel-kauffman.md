How did you learn to debug? While at the Nebraska Code Camp, Carl and Richard talked to Joel Kauffman about debugging practices. Rarely is debugging taught in classes, arguably because all school code is perfect. But code in the real world has bugs, and finding those bugs can be challenging. Joel talks about helping developers understand how debugging works, utilizing stack traces, working backward through code, using watches, and so on. The conversation also digs into various tools available for assisting in debugging production applications, including open source JavaScript libraries and much more expensive dedicated instrumentation products. But good debugging is worth a lot - it's a worthy skill to cultivate!
