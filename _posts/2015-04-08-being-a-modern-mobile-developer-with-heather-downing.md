What does it mean to be a modern mobile developer? While at the Nebraska Code Camp, Carl and Richard talked to Heather Downing about her recent dive into mobile development. In only a few years, Heather has been involved in a number of cool projects and talks about learning on the fly to build native, hybrid, and web-based mobile applications. The conversation explores the advantages and disadvantages of each of the stacks, and the enthusiasm that comes from being effective and successful even without decades of experience. As Heather says, when a new framework comes out, everyone is a novice, no matter how much experience you have. There is no substitute for working hard to learn and understand what the framework brings to the table.
