So how does Docker change development? While at the Nebraska Code Camp, Carl and Richard chatted with Seth Lachner about his work with Docker and the impact it has had on him as a developer. Seth comes from the old school open source world of Linux and C, and has worked with Docker for a long time - he recognized the potential early on. The conversation digs into the concepts of Docker as a virtualization entity on top of an operating system, hooking tightly into the kernel of the operating system to provide isolation for applications without the heavy footprint of traditional VMs. The conversation ranges over the cloud, server and workstation uses of containers, even into the idea of Docker as a virtual application implementation. This tool has far reaching consequences, no wonder there is so much buzz around it!
