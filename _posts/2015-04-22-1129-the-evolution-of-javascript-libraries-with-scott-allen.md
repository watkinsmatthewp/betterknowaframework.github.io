So what JavaScript libraries are you focused on today? Scott Allen is back to talk about the latest bits he's excited about, including Rob Eisenberg's Aurelia! The conversation starts out focused on the on-going evolution of Javascript, with ECMA 6 and 7 picking up more and more features of modern programming languages - it's not the JavaScript you remember from the old days! This also impacts JavaScript libraries and opens the door for the on-going evolution of those libraries. Some change radically like AngularJS and some stick with their patterns so that new tools can get built, like Aurelia. While it's still early days for Aurelia, Scott is so keen that he's dived in as a contributor to the open source product. You should check it out!
