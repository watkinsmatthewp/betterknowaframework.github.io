So when will Moore's Law end? Time for a Geek Out! In honor of the 50th anniversary of Gordon Moore writing the article that 10 years later would be known as Moore's Law, Richard digs into how much work goes into keeping the Moore's Law promise and its impact on society. The conversation delves into the complexities of manufacturing microchips at the nanometer scale, and all of the problems that companies like Intel and Samsung have to overcome for each incremental improvement that leads to a doubling of density every 18-24 months. The laws of physics dictate that Moore's Law will eventually end, but there are still a few years to go... and even when it does end, so what? Is Moore's Law holding back innovations in other areas? Lots to think about!
