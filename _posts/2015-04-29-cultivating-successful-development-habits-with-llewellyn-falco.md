What are the habits that make a successful developer? Carl and Richard talk with Llewellyn Falco about the ongoing process of being the best developer you can be. Llewellyn discusses his role as a consultant to different organizations, and how often he discovers that there are simple practices just not happening within a team that would make everyone more effective. How do you create change in that scenario? How many times do you have to repeat a new approach to things before it actually sticks? Lots of psychology to actually gathering the habits that will make you the best developer you can be!
