We're back from Build! On the last day of Build, Carl and Richard went up to the TWiT.tv studios to record a Windows Weekly with Leo LaPorte, Paul Thurrott and Mary Jo Foley. That show went more than two hours, so we thought we'd make a more condensed version and focus on our favorite bits of Build. And feeing Leo lots of Scotch, you wouldn't want to miss that. The conversation starts out with a bit more of an IT bent, talking about data lakes and docker virtualization. From there Carl digs into the Universal Apps bridges, allowing developers to build iOS and Android apps in Visual Studio with native languages, but across platforms. Check out the link for signing up to the previews of all the Universal App Bridges. What an amazing Build!
