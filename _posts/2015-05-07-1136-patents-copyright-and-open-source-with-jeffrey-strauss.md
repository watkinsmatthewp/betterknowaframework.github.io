How does your organization leverage open source? Carl and Richard talk to Jeff Strauss about open source coming into the corporate space and the challenges that exist there. Microsoft has gone into open source in a big way, how does that affect our development going forward? The conversation starts out talking about Microsoft's approach to open source, especially around the open source promise. From there Jeff dives into the range of open source licenses out there, from the various copyleft concepts in the GPL to the more permissive licenses of MIT and BSD. There's also the whole area of Contributor Licensing as well. You may not love the legal side of software, but that doesn't mean you can ignore it!
