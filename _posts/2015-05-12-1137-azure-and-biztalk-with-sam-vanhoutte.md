So where does BizTalk fit into your Azure application? Carl and Richard talk to Sam Vanhoutte about his work using BizTalk technology to integrate systems together with Azure in the middle. The conversation pokes a little fun at BizTalks's on-going battle for relevance - for the customers that really need it, it is awesome. But now it's available as a cloud product in Azure which can save a ton in hardware fees, enough to run the infrastructure for a long time. Sam also digs into Enterprise Service Buses and their role in the modern infrastructure. Good stuff!
