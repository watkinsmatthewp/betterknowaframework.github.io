Have you been building web apps with TypeScript? Carl and Richard talk to Steve Ognibene about his work with TypeScript projects. The discussion starts with dispelling myths about TypeScript - no, it doesn't exist just to make C# developers more comfortable in web development! Steve compares how development is different in the strongly typed world of C# where the compiler does a bunch of testing for you versus the dynamically typed space of JavaScript where you're responsible for managing type related errors - something that TypeScript can help with! In the end its all JavaScript, and that is evolving also - Steve talks about how ECMA 6 looks a lot more like C#... is there a middle point here we're all racing toward?
