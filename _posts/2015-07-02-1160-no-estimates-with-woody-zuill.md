How do you estimate your projects? While at NDC, Carl and Richard talk to Woody Zuill about delivering software WITHOUT estimates. Woody starts out with a clarification - it's not zero estimates, just no estimates around particular features for an application. But how? Your customers want estimates, the trick is to deliver so quickly that there isn't time to estimate before you've delivered code. And does it have to be code? Isn't our goal to solve problems, and code is only one possible solution? Lots of great thinking about how you provide value to your customers!
