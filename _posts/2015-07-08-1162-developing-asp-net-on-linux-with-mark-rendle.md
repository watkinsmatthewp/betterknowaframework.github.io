So what does it take to develop ASP.NET web sites on Linux? While at NDC in Oslo, Carl and Richard sat down with Mark Rendle to talk through the ins and outs of ASP.NET on Linux. And we're not just talking servers either! Mark talks about what it takes to set up a desktop version of Linux and be able to do ASP.NET development with it, including debugging! The .NET framework is evolving for Linux beyond the Mono project, but there are a bunch of tools out there to help you be productive building ASP.NET on whatever client platform you want. Check out the links!
