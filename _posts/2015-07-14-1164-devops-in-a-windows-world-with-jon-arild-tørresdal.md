What's missing from the DevOps story in the Windows world? While at NDC in Oslo, Carl and Richard sat down with Jon Arild TÃ¸rresdal to talk about his struggles to have an effective DevOps practice in his organization using Windows technology. Jon talks about getting his teams to continuous deployment, rather than continuous delivery, so that there is a human interceding before software is deployed to the customer. Lots of conversation about instrumentation approaches, and getting to a place where code is deployed effectively for testing, but not visible to the customer. There's lots of challenges to a DevOps practice in the Windows world, but you can make it work!
