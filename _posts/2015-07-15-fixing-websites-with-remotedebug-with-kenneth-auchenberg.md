How do you debug browser problems in your web apps? Carl and Richard talk to Kenneth Auchenberg about RemoteDebug, an open source tool to bring a common debugging solution across browsers. And Ken really means across browsers - you can connect Chrome, Opera, FireFox, Safari and Internet Explorer up simultaneously and see how your code changes affect the rendering of your page on all those browsers at the same time! Oh, and it works for mobile browsers also, so you can experiment with rendering on multiple phones at once, and see how the pages really look while you make changes. You need to check this amazing tool out!
