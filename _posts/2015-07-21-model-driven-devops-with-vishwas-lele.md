What's your DevOps plan? Carl and Richard talk to Vishwas Lele about taking a comprehensive, model-driven approach to DevOps. What does it mean to be model-driven? Working with a strategic approach that is agnostic to any given technology or platform - but in the end, the tools do matter! Vishwas talks about common elements like a single repository for all assets, repeatable deployment processes, instrumentation and feedback mechanisms that enable the entire team to see how the software is being used and improved. He also talks about the Azure templates for getting infrastructure up and running quickly - and the on-going evolution to let this model work anywhere, not just in the cloud!
