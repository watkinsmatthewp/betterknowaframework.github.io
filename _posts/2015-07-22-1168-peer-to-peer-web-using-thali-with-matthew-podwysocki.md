Peer-to-Peer is more than BitTorrent! Carl and Richard talk to Matthew Podwysocki about the Thali Project, using peer-to-peer technology to put more power in the hands of the users. Matthew talks about being able to communicate between your various devices using WiFi and Bluetooth while maintaining privacy and not bouncing off a cloud server. The cornerstone is security, using TLS to encrypt all traffic in and out of your device. Messaging strategy, data synchronization and more are all part of the Thali Project, making this great technology all open source for anyone to use!
