How does Windows 10 change NuGet? Carl and Richard talk to Jeff Fritz about the new features being added to NuGet to support Windows 10 Universal Apps. The core feature is the ability to build a NuGet package that will run on all the Windows 10 universal platforms - PC, tablet and phone. The conversation then switches to the Visual Studio 2015 launch and the crazy three day hackathon preceding it that Jeff participated in, building the AllReady applications for Humanitarian Toolbox and the RedCross. The project is now open source on GitHub and ready for lots of contributors, check it out!
