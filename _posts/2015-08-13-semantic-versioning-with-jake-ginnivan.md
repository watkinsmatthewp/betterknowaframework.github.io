How do you manage version numbers? Carl and Richard talk to Jake Ginnivan about his open source project called GitVersion. GitVersion works to automate the semantic versioning of your software. The conversation starts out focused on the details of semantic versioning - beyond the major.minor.patch, there are the alpha, beta and release candidate builds. Jake walks through the process of automating versioning, being able to understand what changes you've made to your code to know what numbers need to increment. This is a cool tool to check out!
