So what happens when you dive head-first into the latest Javascript libraries? Carl and Richard chat with Julie Lerman about her experiences playing with Rob Eisenberg's Aurelia library. Of course, it doesn't stop there: If you're going to learn Aurelia, you're going to change the whole stack - including node, expressjs and DocumentDB! Julie walks through the process of adding each of the bits into the stack, learning online through search engines and twitter, and what she brought back from this exploration that changed the way she works with C# and Entity Framework!
