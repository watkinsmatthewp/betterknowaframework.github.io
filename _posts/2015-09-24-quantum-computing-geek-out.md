The most requested (and most postponed) Geek Out of them all - Quantum Computing. How much is hype, and how much is real? Richard walks through the history of quantum computing, starting with the understanding of quantum mechanics in the first place, and how modelling that in a classical computer created problems. As it turns out, there are many approaches to quantum computing, and no "one right way" has appeared yet. The state of quantum computing today is like the state of classical computing in the 1950s before the advent of the transistor. Possible, but very difficult and not broadly applicable. Let us know what you think!
