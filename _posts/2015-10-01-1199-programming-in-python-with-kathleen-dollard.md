Kathleen Dollard has been exploring different development environments and wants to tell the world! Carl and Richard talk to Kathleen about her experience using Python and Django with JetBrain's IntelliJ development environment. As Kathleen says, it's the whole development suite, not just a given language, that you have to evaluate as a whole. But if you're going to live in the dynamic language like Python, you need to take testing seriously - and Kathleen dives into her experience of doing semantic testing to build resilient tests that are easy to read and have comprehensive coverage. The conversation turns to the story of how all this came to pass - Kathleen's new job and new leadership role with a consulting firm has pushed her to try new things!
