There's more great stuff in Studio than you realize! Carl and Richard talk to Charles Sterling about the web performance testing tools built into Visual Studio 2015. Actually, the testing tools have been there since 2008, but only in the test edition, and after that they were moved to the Ultimate Edition - they were part of what made that product so expensive! But as of 2015, the testing tools are available as part of Visual Studio Online, which means they're free for teams of five or fewer as well as all MSDN subscribers! Chuck talks about what it takes to build really great load tests - the kinds of questions you can answer, and how to build those tests into your continuous deployment system. Check it out!
