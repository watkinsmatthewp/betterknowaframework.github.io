Have you seen The Martian? Don't listen to this show until you do! WARNING: SPOILERS! But if you've seen it (or don't care), have a listen to this Geek Out about the movie and a deeper dive into the challenges of Mars, picking up where the last Geek Out on Manned Mars Missions left off. How is the movie different from the book? (they're both great, read or watch in either order) And how sciencey is the science? The movie is remarkably technically accurate, but there are some bits that are Hollywoodised, as well as dramatized for effect. But who cares? It's an awesome movie and a fun Geek Out! Have a listen!
