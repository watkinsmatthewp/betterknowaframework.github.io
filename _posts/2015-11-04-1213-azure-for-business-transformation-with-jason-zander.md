How can Azure change your business? Carl and Richard talk to Jason Zander, one of the original developers of .NET and now a corporate vice president, about the power of Azure to affect change in your business. Jason talks about the landscape of Azure today, and how the engineers are able to push out a feature almost every week - 500 new features in the past year! You may not need to move that fast, but it's nice to know if you build against Azure, that's what is possible. The conversation ranges over the role of IoT, security, web sites and more - there's a lot of things that can be built in Azure, and the opportunities are massive!
