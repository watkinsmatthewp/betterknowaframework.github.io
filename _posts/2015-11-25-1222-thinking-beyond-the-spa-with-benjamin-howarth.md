How do you make the Single Page Application (SPA) better? Carl and Richard talk to Benjamin Howarth about his experiences with building SPAs and solving some of their limitations. Users love the look of a SPA, its responsiveness and styling are powerful. But SPAs have problems - they are very hard to test properly, they resist search engine indexing, are bandwidth hungry and not accessible to folks with visual impairments. Benjamin talks about his library RomanSPA (see what he did there?) that builds a normal MVC app behind the scenes and then can selectively render pages via MVC or the SPA approach as needed. Could this be the better SPA?
