How do you stop your data lake from being a data swamp? Carl and Richard talk to Tom Kerkhove about Azure Data Lakes. The conversation digs into the impact the cloud has had a data warehousing - when you have as much compute and storage as you need on demand, does it still make sense to jump through all the hoops that data warehousing requires? Tom talks about Data Lakes storing all data as it arrives from a huge variety of sources and leaving that data in its native format, so that it is available for analysis as needed. Universal SQL (U-SQL) is the query language of Data Lakes, which is more LINQ-like, but speaks to the power of being able to join anything to anything with the cloud!
