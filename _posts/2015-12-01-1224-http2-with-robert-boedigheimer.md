HTTP/2? No really! We're only now getting to the second version of HTTP! Carl and Richard talk to Robert Boedigheimer about the next version of HTTP. In truth, this will be the fourth version of HTTP. Robert talks about how long-in-the-tooth HTTP/1.1 has gotten and the need to update the protocol to reflect the reality of the web - much bigger pages with many more resources on them. While a portion of the change represented by HTTP/2 is plumbing - modern browsers already support it, the web servers are coming soon, eventually web page design will be affected, mostly simplifying performance tuning tricks. It'll make a better web!
