How do you build a tool that bridges data silos? Carl and Richard talk to Tim Ward about his work on CluedIn, a tool for connecting documents, email and other business resources together so that employees can see what everyone is working on with a minimum of fuss. Tim talks about using different data stores within CluedIn to leverage their strengths - the graph storage of neo4J maintains relationships between documents where ElasticSearch actually finds things. The art of tagging and cataloging is key, so fighting the tools isn't the best plan. Give a try!
