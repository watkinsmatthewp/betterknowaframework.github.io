How technical is technical debt? Carl and Richard talk to Einar HÃ¸st about how technical debt has more to do with your understanding of a system and the intentional shortcuts we take to make deadlines than anything specific to technology. The conversation dives into the domain driven design thinking of Eric Evans and the challenges of deeply understanding the domain of a system well enough to build great software to model it. As Einar puts it, some complexity is intentional, and some is accidental. That accidental complexity can be considered technical debt, but it is always challenging to measure it. In the end, the key is communications!
