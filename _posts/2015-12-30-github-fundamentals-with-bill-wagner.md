Do you understand how to develop software with GitHub? Carl and Richard walk through the fundamentals of GitHub with Bill Wagner. Bill walks through the key differences between the distributed source control that is GitHub versus the more classic central control style source control systems. Often it is harder for experienced developers to deal with the reality of GitHub than someone new to source control! The conversation explores all the concepts of GitHub - repositories, cloning, forking, push and pull requests, merging and rebasing. There's a lot to know, but there are great tools for getting started. And at the end, a quick discussion about Humanitarian Toolbox and their awesome open source projects to help save lives - you can help!
