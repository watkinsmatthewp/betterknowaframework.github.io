What is the good and bad of being an old programmer? To wrap up 2015, Carl and Richard chat with Gary Wisniewski about his blog post on the subject and more! Gary is the same Gary of Carl and Gary's VB Home Page, one of the first web sites on Visual Basic way back in 1994. The conversation digs into what's great about having lots of experience, and how it came hold you back as well. There's no magic to being a programmer at 20 years old and there's no magic when you're 60 either - it's got more to do with your thinking than your age! And hey, while we're at it, have a great new year! See you in 2016!
