What is it like managing a mature open source project? Carl and Richard talk to Jimmy Bogard about his experiences with AutoMapper, an open source project he started back in 2009 that is still going strong today. While open source has been around for many years, the ecosystem has been evolving, and Jimmy talks about how site like GitHub and Stack Overflow has made it much easier to stay engaged with your user base and have meaningful conversations about code - without having to repeat yourself over and over. The discussion also dives into the challenges of contributions, people's sometimes unreasonable expectations, and just being patient with the world while you write code you actually use. Great thinking from a guy who's been there!
