Are space elevators really possible, or just science fiction? Time for a Geek Out! Carl and Richard chat about the idea of being able to build a cable from the surface of the Earth into space to make space transport 100 times cheaper than rockets. The conversation starts out focused on the concept of space tethers, of which the space elevator is one particular species. Tethers have actually flown in space and demonstrated some amazing properties, including using the magnetic field of the earth to generate electricity. Tethers can also be used as Skyhooks to lift and fling payloads into orbit. Richard then digs into the details of space elevators themselves, including the materials needed for the cable, construction approaches and the sheer scale of what is needed to make an elevator. Possible? Maybe!
