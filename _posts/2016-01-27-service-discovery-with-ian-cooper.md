Service Discovery? Is UDDI back? While at NDC London, Carl and Richard talk to Ian Cooper about service discovery in the microservices world. Ian talks about the effect of microservices in making systems more complex - it's easy to end up with hundreds of services. And you don't want to be hard-coding service locations into your application, what happens when things change? While you could roll your own, Ian talks about a range of tools already out there to help your applications discover the services they need. Everything needs to be redundant and reliable - which is actually hard to build. Check out the links for all sorts of great tools!
