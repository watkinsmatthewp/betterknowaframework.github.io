What do you know about R? While at NDC London, Carl and Richard talked to Barbara Fusinska about her work using R as part of real system. Barbara talks about the role of statistics and machine learning as well as the various tools that make it easier to incorporate into your application. The conversation turns to MatLab and Revolution Analytics language R. R is focused on machine learning, it's not a general purpose language. Think of it as SQL for machine learning - great at the thing it does, but not for everything. And now that Microsoft owns R, you can expect to see it more and more in the .NET development world!
