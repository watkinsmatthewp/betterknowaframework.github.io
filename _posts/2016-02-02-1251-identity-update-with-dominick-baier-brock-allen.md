How are you managing identity? While at NDC in London, Carl and Richard talk to Dominick Baier and Brock Allen about their work Identity Server. Now part of the .NET Foundation (making it easier for enterprises to being open source into their organization), Identity Server can provide the authentication services across all your applications. That naturally leads to a discussion on the authorization side of things, which focuses more on claims-based security specific to each application and the needs for other tools. Getting identity right is hard, but Identity Server takes you down the right path!
