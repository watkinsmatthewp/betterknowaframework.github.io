How can you make machine learning simpler? While at NDC London, Carl and Richard talked to Seth Juarez about his open source project NuML. Seth has been working on NuML since 2011, providing tooling to let developers think more about the goals of their machine learning than the specific mathematical concepts involved. But he reinforces that you do need to learn some core concepts of machine learning no matter what! You can run NuML anywhere you like, but if you're working in the cloud, Seth mentions AzureML as having similar concepts to NuML, but built to work at cloud scales. Machine learning is becoming a critical capability for organizations - are you ready?
