What does your company do when it brings in new hires? While at NDC London, Carl and Richard talked to Jessie Shternshus of the Improv Effect about how she helps organizations create fun, innovative onboarding processes that actually reflect the culture of the company. Jessie talks about various exercises she uses to help folks get comfortable with a team and communicate effectively. The conversation digs into how every organization has a culture that new people see, the question is only how intentional that culture actually is - is the reality that its a sink-or-swim kind of place? Or do you really support the success of everyone? Lots of laughs and fun while thinking about how to make your company great!
