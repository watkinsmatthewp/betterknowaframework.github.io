What patterns make sense with containers? At NDC London, Carl and Richard talk to Ben Hall about some more mature pattern approaches to container implementations, specifically with Docker. Ben talks through a number of key patterns that make containers work the way you expect in production. There are key elements such as immutability, avoiding circumventing the configuration-as-code mindset of containers. Containers should be built, torn down and built again from their scripts, rather than ever updated. Along the way, Ben discusses a variety of tools and resources to support good container patterns - check out the show links!
