How can you learn what your users like about your application and what you can do to make it better? Enter user research! While at NDC London, Carl and Richard talked to Lily Dart about her approaches to doing user research - guerrilla style! Lily talks about being out on street corners asking passersby to look at an application on a smartphone and give their impressions, all for a Starbucks card. The trick is not to take what they say literally, but to actually watch how they interact with the application, what works and what doesn't. In some apps, the camera is always on so they can record the facial expressions of the tester! Lots of cool thoughts on how to collect data from users!
