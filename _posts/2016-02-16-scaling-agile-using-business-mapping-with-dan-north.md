Can Agile scale to thousands of people? While at NDC London, Carl and Richard sat down with Dan North (and a bottle of scotch) and had a deep conversation about the limits of agile and how we can get beyond that limit. Agile naturally lends itself to feature teams - 5-10 people who have a variety of skills that can get a feature out the door. But to build more substantial software, you need more people, typically broken into more teams... and that generates the scrum-of-scrums, etc. Dan talks about organizing teams differently to keep productivity high and the quality where it needs to be - scale agile!
