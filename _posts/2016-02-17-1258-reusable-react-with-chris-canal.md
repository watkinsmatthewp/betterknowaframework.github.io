Can React make your web pages more reusable? While on the Scot Net Rocks tour, Carl and Richard stopped in Edinburgh to chat with Chris Canal about his work with React. The conversation turns to a stack of tools you may never had heard of for building reliable, maintainable and testable JavaScript code - no really, check out the links! Chris talks about how React creates objects, mixing JavaScript, HTML and CSS together into something that can be reused effectively, but only if you know how to manage it. And that's where the tooling comes in. Check it out!
