Geeking out on agriculture? Of course! While food is rarely the number one issue in the western world, food quality and security always bring out a certain level of anxiety in people. So how did we get here? Are we going to run out of food? Is the population explosion going to doom mankind? Or will it be climate change? Can technology actually work through all these problems? Carl and Richard discuss how agriculture started, how it has evolved and what the future could look like going forward - this is a foundational show for even more conversations about how we feed the world and ourselves - be part of that conversation!
