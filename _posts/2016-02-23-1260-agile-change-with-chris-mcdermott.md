How can you bring change to your organization in an agile way? While on the ScotNetRocks tour, Carl and Richard talked to Chris McDermott about his experiences bringing agile to companies, and how that affected change. The conversation explores the idea that companies are actually highly resistant to change - change represents risk, and risk should be avoided. How do you really embrace change? Chris talks about managing the risk by making the cost of failure small, effectively lowering the risk. That means being able to measure how things are working so you know when you're failing sooner and can change course efficiently. Change is good - you go first!
