How do you get started with machine learning? On the last stop of the Scot Net Rocks tour, Carl and Richard talked to Gary Short about his work independently and now with Microsoft building machine learning solutions for a large variety of companies. Gary talks about the evolution of machine learning, and how the cloud has become a critical part of the equation. With the cloud, you can harness as much compute power as you need when you need it, and turn it off when you don't. That solves a ton of machine learning problems - as Gary explains, you don't have to pick a perfect algorithm, you can just run them all and then analyze them together!
