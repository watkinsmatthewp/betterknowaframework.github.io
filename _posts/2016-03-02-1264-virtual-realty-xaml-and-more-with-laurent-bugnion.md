What does Virtual Reality and XAML have to do with each other? Carl and Richard talk to Laurent Bugnion about his work around building virtual reality software. The challenge, as Laurent puts it, is the whole 3D issue. Building 3D software is tricky, and the tooling is hugely important. The conversation turns to tools like Unity3D, which is very popular in the 3D space. But can XAML do the job? What is the development experience like? What can you build and how do you test it? And what can we really do with virtual reality beyond gaming? Great conversation with a guy who's built a ton of awesome software!
