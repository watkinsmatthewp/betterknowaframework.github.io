Have you used the biggest, most complex Single Page Application (SPA) in the world? It's the Azure Portal! Carl and Richard talk to Jakub Jedryszek, one of the folks building the framework that runs the Azure Portal. Jakub talks about the portal framework being built on TypeScript and Knockout so that all the different Microsoft teams building Azure products don't get delayed in delivery because they can't get on the portal. The challenge is to keep everything orderly so that folks using the Portal can actually make sense of it, and that takes a lot of negotiations and management within the teams. Software is hard, but expectation management is even harder!
