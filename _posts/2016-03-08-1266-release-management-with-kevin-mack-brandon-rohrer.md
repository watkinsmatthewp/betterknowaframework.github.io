How do you manage your software releases? Carl and Richard talk to Kevin Mack and Brandon Rohrer about the various tools that come together to help automate software releases. The focus on this approach is a product formerly known as InRelease by InCycle, which was acquired by Microsoft back in 2013. Now it's known as Release Management Services for VSTS and deeply integrated with the Studio toolset. The conversation also dives into the challenges around databases when it comes to release management - how do you get your database to be part of your release? Lots to think about here to up your VSTS game!
