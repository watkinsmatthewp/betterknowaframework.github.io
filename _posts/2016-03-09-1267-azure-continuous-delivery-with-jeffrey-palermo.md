Can you continuously deliver software on Azure? Carl and Richard talk to Jeffrey Palermo about his approach (and toolkit) to do continuous delivery - and Azure makes it far more feasible! The conversation starts out with some definitions, recognizing that the development community has been working its way toward faster delivery of value to customers for a long time - it's part of the Agile Manifesto. The question is purely how fast, or rather, how continuous is continuous? Jeff also notes that delivery doesn't mean deployment, but it does mean that you're at the place where you can immediately deploy when you're ready. Lots of tools and thinking on how to get this done, it isn't simple!
