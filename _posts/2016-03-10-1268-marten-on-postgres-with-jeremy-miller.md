What's missing from most document data storage technology? Carl and Richard talk to Jeremy Miller about Marten, an open source document data store library that runs on top of PostGreSQL. Why would you run a document store on top of a relational database? For the features! Jeremy talks about how PostGreSQL brings the backup systems, development tooling and all that DevOps goodness to Marten. Under the hood, documents are stored as JSONB files - better than BLOBs, they're actually searchable JSON. You can treat Marten like a pure document store, or go under the hood and write SQL. Another cool way to up your data storage game!
