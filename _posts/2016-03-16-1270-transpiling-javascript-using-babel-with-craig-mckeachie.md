Ready to transpile your Javascript? Carl and Richard chat with Craig McKeachie about BabelJS, an open source tool for transpiling Javascript. Why would you want to do that? So you can write in the latest version of Javascript and still have it run everywhere! Craig talks about how the rate of evolution in Javascript is increasing, and the jump that is ECMAScript 6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, makes the language a lot more, well C#-like. But the implementations in browsers is not as even, and that doesn't account for features coming in ECMAScript 7! Babel deals with this problem by transpiling into Javascript that runs everywhere. Check it out!
