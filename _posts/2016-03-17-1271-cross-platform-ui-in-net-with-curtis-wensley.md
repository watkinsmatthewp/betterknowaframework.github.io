How do you build cross-platform desktop applications? Carl and Richard talk to Curtis Wensley about eto.forms, an open source project he started back in 2006 to deal with cross-platform challenges. Originally focused on mobile, Curtis recognized that Xamarin was moving seriously into that space and pivoted to the desktop side, just in time for Silverlight to go into limbo. Under the hood, eto depends on various Mono related elements, although Curtis sees a day when it will all be .NET Core. The mobile stuff works too, so it is possible to build an app that works on desktop, tablet and phone. Is eto more universal than Universal Apps? Check it out!
