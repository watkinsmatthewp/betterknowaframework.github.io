Ready for the new Angular? Carl and Richard talk to John Papa about Angular 2 being in beta. And really in beta - John mentions that for the past few betas, updating his samples have only taken a few minutes, not hours. The conversation also dives into the controversy around the significant differences between Angular 1 and 2, although John sees it as simplification. A lot of ceremony that existed in Angular 1 has been eliminated, or implemented as part of standard tags. The role of Reactive Extensions for Javascript is significant as well: Everything is becoming asynchronous!
