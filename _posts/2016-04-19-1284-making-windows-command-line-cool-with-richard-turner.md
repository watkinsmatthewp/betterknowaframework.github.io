How can the command line be cool? Carl and Richard talk to Richard Turner, freshly back into Microsoft, and working on the Bash on Windows project. So why would you want a Linux command line prompt? As Richard explains, there are cool bits of code you can create on your Windows box but don't really behave all that well - some Ruby Gems, etc. Having Linux, real Linux, running in Windows helps all that work better. And if you're headed toward the cross-platform world in the mobile space, or Linux on the backend, these tools can help you be more productive and less frustrated. It's early days yet, but there's lots to check out!
