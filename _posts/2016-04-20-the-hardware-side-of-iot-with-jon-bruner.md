How has hardware evolved when it comes to the Internet of Things? While at Build 2016 in San Francisco, Carl and Richard sat down with Jon Bruner from O'Reilly SOLID Con about his experience watching and working with the makers of hardware for IoT. Jon dug into the challenges of making production IoT stuff, especially going to China to get things made at scale. Automation is taking hold in that space, soon where it's done won't matter all that much. The conversation also explores additive and subtractive manufacturing with CNC milling machines, laser sintering and more. Lots of cool hardware ideas!
