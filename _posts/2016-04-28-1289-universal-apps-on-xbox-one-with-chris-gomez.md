Universal Apps are becoming more universal - arriving on the XBox One! Carl and Richard talk to Chris Gomez about the announcements at the Microsoft Build event around building software for the XBox One. Now, any developer can write code using the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) approach, which means you can code in C#, Javascript... pretty much any language you want in the CLR space. Chris explains that while you have limited access to all the resources in the XBox One, the UWP approach is a starting point to building bigger things if that's what you want to do - the XBox team is watching!
