How do you deploy your applications? While at DevIntersection, Carl and Richard chatted with Damian Brady from Octopus about the latest version of Octopus Deploy. Damian talks about all the changes that have come in Octopus 3, using SQL Server to store deployment information, getting more involved with deployment to Azure, and so on. The conversation also digs into the impact of open source and support for Linux and OSX, which means looking at a change of dependencies when it comes to things like nuget. There's lots to talk about in deployment, things are only getting better!
