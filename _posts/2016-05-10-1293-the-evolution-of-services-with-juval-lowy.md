So is every class a service? While at DevIntersection in Orlando, Carl and Richard talk to Juval Lowy about how his statement nearly ten years ago has in some ways come true. Juval talks about how services evolved back in the 2006 time frame into monolithic, unmanageable software and the swing to simplification that has led to the current microservices movement. Keeping services small and flexible is the key, to the point that you see service aspects appearing down in very fine grained parts of software: Integer as a Service? Great thinking from an experienced architect of how services continue to evolve!
