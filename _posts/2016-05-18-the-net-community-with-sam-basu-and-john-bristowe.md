Where is the .NET community going? Carl and Richard talk to Sam Basu and John Bristowe of Telerik about the data they've gathered in their 2016 Developer Report. The conversation explores what languages and tools developers visiting the Telerik site are using, with lots of exploration around the evolution of mobile development. Desktop development plays a role as well - and lots of folks are still building WinForms apps! The latest news out of Microsoft has piqued folks interest in open source and cross-platform development, but how important is it to developers right now? Grab a copy of the report and follow along with the analysis!
