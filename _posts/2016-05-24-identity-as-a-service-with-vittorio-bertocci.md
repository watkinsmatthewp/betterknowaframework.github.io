How can you keep your customer identity information safe? While at Techorama in Mechelen, Belgium, Carl and Richard talk to Vittorio Bertocci about Microsoft's offerings around Azure Active Directory. With all the data breaches going on these days, its wise to consider offloading the work of managing your customer's personally identifiable information to a service that has as much security around it as possible. Vittorio talks about the new B2C service on Azure offering the ability to store custom information, authorization tokens - everything you'll need to know who your user is and what they are able to do. That's half your security battle done, just gotta secure your transactions!
