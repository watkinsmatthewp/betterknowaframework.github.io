What does modern open source look like? While at Techorama in Belgium, Carl and Richard moderated a panel of Bill Wagner, Udi Dahan, Nik Molnar and Jimmy Bogard to discuss their experiences working in open source in this day and age. Much of the discussion focuses the various approaches that folks make a living while building and maintaining open source projects. Does it make sense for a commercial product to be open source? What's the right way to go about that? Why would someone put their project into an entity like the Dot Net Foundation? What happens when large companies want to take a dependency on your little open source project? Lots of great thinking from folks who have been there!
