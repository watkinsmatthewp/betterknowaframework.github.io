How do you change a developer's mind? While at Techorama in Belgium, Carl and Richard talk to Julie Lerman about her experiences working with a variety of teams moving into new technologies and techniques. While some folks are happy to jump into the latest-and-greatest, others are more cautious or even resistant - and often for good reason. There's always a productivity hit with changing up tooling and process, with substantial benefits coming further down the path. How can you help people "get over the hump" of engaging with a new tool or approach? What do you do about the poisonous folks that resist change through verbal and in some cases even direct sabotage? Everyone is different, and you need to take the time to understand where people's concerns lie. Often once someone is understood, they are much more open to change!
