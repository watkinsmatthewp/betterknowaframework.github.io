How do you manage your non-relational data? While at Techorama in Belgium, Carl and Richard talk to Oren Eini about his work with RavenDB and getting companies to really think about organizing non-relational data in a sensible way. The conversation focuses on how much relational database methodology (like normalization) has permeated thinking in development, so that we tend toward similar behavior when working on a non-relational data store. Store the objects as objects, it's going to be okay!
