Ready to think differently about programming? While at Techorama in Belgium, Carl and Richard chatted with Mark Seemann about his experiences with Haskell, helping him to be the best functional programmer he can be. Mark talks about the battle of developing in F#, and how it's easy to fall into object-centric development methods, even when F# strongly encourages function-centric coding. By spending time in a pure functional language like Haskell, you strengthen those functional reflexes! The language has been around for a long time and runs on all sorts of platforms including Windows. It's a great tool to make you a better developer!
