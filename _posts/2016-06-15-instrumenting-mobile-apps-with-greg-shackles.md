Do you know how people are actually using your mobile apps? Carl and Richard chat with Greg Shackles about his work instrumenting mobile apps in production. The low hanging fruit is actually gathering data about every crash or error that occurs in the field. Getting that information back to your dev team can make the application better, but what if operations were able to respond to the failure? What if you could turn a crash into a moment of delight for the user? The conversation then dives into deeper instrumentation - what can we learn about how people use the app, what is hard and easy, and what we could add to make the app more awesome. Lots of great thinking on taking mobile apps to the next level!
