What's next for C#? While at NDC Oslo, Carl and Richard talked with Mads Torgersen about what's coming up in C# 7. But first some fun, talking about how languages evolve and the challenge of bringing new features to life while avoiding breaking what has come before. It's not easy building languages, especially popular ones! Mads talks about the process of deciding what is in and what will be pushed out for the next version of C#. Along the way, the discussion turns to grabbing onto great ideas from other languages (like pattern matching from F#) while still remaining true to the C# way of doing things. If you want an F# feature, use F#, but that doesn't preclude running with good ideas. A fun discussion with the guy who drives C# forward!
