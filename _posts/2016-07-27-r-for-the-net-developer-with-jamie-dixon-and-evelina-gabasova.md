Ready to learn R? While at NDC Oslo, Carl and Richard sat down with Jamie Dixon and Evelina Gabasova to talk about what .NET developers need to know to get conversant in R. Data science represents a huge opportunity for developers these days, helping businesses actually take advantage of the data the company has. Jamie comes at R from a traditional .NET developer perspective, talking about how there are some skills (like source control and testing) that developers have more experience with than most data science folks. Evelina talks about the academic side of using R, learning statistical modeling and how to talk to data science experts when you're a developer. There's a great community out there to help you learn more and focus on the right things - join in!
