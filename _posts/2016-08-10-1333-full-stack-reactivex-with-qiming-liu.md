What's a really modern web app look like? Carl and Richard talk to Qiming Liu about the Reactive Trader Cloud, demonstrating the synergy between the cloud, containers, microservices, the Reactive Extensions Framework and ReactJS on the client to make a real time currency trader application. The application is on GitHub, you can take it out for a spin for yourself and get a feel for this cool architecture. Qiming talks about treating all data as streams with the Reactive Framework for Javascript, passing messages to the various microservices to complete transactions. Packaging up those microservices in containers allows for resiliency and scalability - you just launch more instances using (in this case) Kubernetes. Check out the code!
