Could there really be airliners powered by electricity? Time for a Geek Out! The conversation starts out with Richard talking about the Solar Impulse, a single seat aircraft with a wingspan larger than a 747, that has flown around the world powered solely by the solar panels covering it. So yes, electric aircraft are real, but could they be made commercially viable? NASA continues to fund various research projects to improve modern airliners by increasing fuel efficiency, decrease emissions and noise. Electric powerplants could help in all those aspects, but how much power can you pack into an aircraft and how much do you need? We're closer than you think!
