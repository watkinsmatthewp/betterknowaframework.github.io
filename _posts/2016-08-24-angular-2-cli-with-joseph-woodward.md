Why would a client-side Javascript library have a command line interface? Carl and Richard talk to Joseph Woodward about the power of the Angular CLI. It's all about the scripting! Joseph talks about all those tedious tasks involved in getting an application set up when you're ready to push out to the world. Angular CLI is all about automating that process using NodeJS style modules. The conversation also explores utilizing as many existing tools as possible, like Bower, Sass, and so on. You don't have to depend on Visual Studio if you don't want to - there are lots of ways to get deployed!
