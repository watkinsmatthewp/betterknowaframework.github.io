We all want to believe we have good habits when it comes to programming - but what about the bad habits? Carl and Richard chat with Steve Smith and Brendan Enrick about some of the many anti-patterns that exist in software development. Part of this conversation also ties back to a cool product that Steve and Brendan create - the Software Craftsmanship calendar! Be part of the Kickstarter and get yourself a hilarious and inspirational calendar!
