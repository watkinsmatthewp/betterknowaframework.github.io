How about *no* JavaScript libraries? Carl and Richard talk to Chris Love about his passion with making the smallest, fastest web applications possible. The conversation starts out with the idea that JavaScript libraries, like most code libraries, constantly grow - old code, support for things that don't matter any more, and features that you aren't using, all add up to a lot of bytes and compute time that you don't need to waste. Chris talks about how he doesn't write everything from scratch, he has built some very small libraries (check the links) that do only the things you absolutely need. You can be an HTML Native with just the code you need to make an application do what it needs to!
