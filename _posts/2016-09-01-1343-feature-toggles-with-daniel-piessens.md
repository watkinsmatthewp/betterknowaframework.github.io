Are you adding feature toggles to your apps? Carl and Richard talk to Daniel Piessens about his approach to adding feature toggles, using frameworks to keep things organized. The conversation starts out talking about different kinds of features toggles, starting with the classic one that allows you to build features over time, but keep the code in the trunk, just not visible to the users until you're ready. In some cases, that feature toggle because permanent because it is a tool for ops to reduce load on a server at peak times. Toggles are also a strategy for A/B testing of different features, styling and advertising - you need to dig into this!
