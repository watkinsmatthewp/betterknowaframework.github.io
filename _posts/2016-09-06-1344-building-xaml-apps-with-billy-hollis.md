Are you building XAML-driven applications yet? Carl and Richard chat with Billy Hollis about what it takes to get going with building XAML applications. As Billy says, XAML is a "compositional" platform, which is a very different way to think about how to build user interfaces. Ultimately, these design principles become platform-agnostic - you can use whatever tools you want to build them. Is it hard to think this way? It does take time, but the products you make stand out as just a better way to work with computers. Your customers will thank you!
