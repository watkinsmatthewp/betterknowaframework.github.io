Can you build a line of business web application and not write any JavaScript? Carl and Richard talk to Tom치코 Herceg about his open source project called DotVVM. With DotVVM, you write your ViewModel in C# and your View in HTML. The JavaScript is generated at run time, and you never need to look at it. While there are free open source elements to the project, there are also "pro" editions of some features that you can pay for to keep the project going. Lots of controls to make your pages look good with a minimum amount of code. And it works with ASP.NET Core!
