What if a data storage library just stored and retrieved your data? What if it wasn't a mollusk? Carl and Richard talk to Mark Rendle about his refocusing on his open source library called Simple.Data - now with .NET Core! Mark talks about why Simple.Data is not an ORM, and why you don't want to use an ORM anyway. And yeah, the conversation gets sillier from there! Mark also talks about what it means to build a library that runs on all the platform (because Core) and the challenge of getting everything together to run on the other platforms like Linux. And yes, we know a library can't be a mollusk, but it could be an ORM, and nobody wants that.
