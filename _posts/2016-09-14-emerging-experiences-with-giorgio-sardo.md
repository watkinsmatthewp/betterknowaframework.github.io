What's an "Emerging Experience" and why would you want one? Carl and Richard talk to Giorgio Sardo about Microsoft's overarching term for all of the new ways we connect humans to computers, and how much more fun it is to program beyond the keyboard and mouse! Of course it's easy to jump right to HoloLens, which is very cool, but there is so much more in the space. Giorgio talks about some of the Cognitive Services features available including LUIS, which is all about having a really natural conversation with your machine, and how it's possible to write code to work with it without a PhD in Linguistics! There's a ton of links to a host of cool tools for moving into this new space of development. Computing technology is permeating the world, and Microsoft is working hard to let your existing skills take advantage of it. Jump in!
