The rumors of the death of WebForms is greatly exaggerated! Carl and Richard talk to Jeff Fritz, who runs with WebForms team (yes, there is a team!) about what's happening in the WebForms world. While WebForms is not coming to ASP.NET Core, it is a part of regular Windows-centric ASP.NET Framework, and there are new features continuing to be built. Jeff talks about what a modern WebForms app looks like - ViewState is gone, and PostBack checking is obsolete - you can use ASync Model Binding in WebForms! The conversation also digs into how the relationship between the community and the ASP.NET team has evolved... so much more of what's being done is visible and can be discussed before decisions are made!
