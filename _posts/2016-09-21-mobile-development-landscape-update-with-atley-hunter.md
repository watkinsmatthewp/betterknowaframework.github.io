Digging into what it's like to build mobile applications today with someone who's built more than just about anyone - Atley Hunter! Carl and Richard chat with Atley about what is working for him today and what's not. Atley talks about revenue potential from iOS, Android and Windows Phone apps (yes, there still is some revenue there), and what approaches make sense for actually building cross-platform apps today. While he's capable of native development, he's also looking close at the various evolving tools out there. Atley also digs into the challenges of the various app stores - the problems continue. It's tricky to make money on mobile apps, but it is possible, you just have to know your options!
