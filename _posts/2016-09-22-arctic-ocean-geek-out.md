Back from the wilds, Richard Campbell has stories of the Arctic Ocean! Carl asks questions to Richard about his experience on a 12-day sail around the Svalbard islands and up into the arctic ice to see polar bears, walrus and a huge assortment of sea birds. There's also stories about the crazy adventurers of the 19th and 20th century trying to get to be the first to the north pole - and most didn't make it. Ultimately the conversation comes back to the marine mammal known as the polar bear. Is it doomed? It seems inevitable now that the polar ice will melt. But it's not the first time in history that has happened to the polar bear, but mankind can help protect the bear so it has a chance to survive!
