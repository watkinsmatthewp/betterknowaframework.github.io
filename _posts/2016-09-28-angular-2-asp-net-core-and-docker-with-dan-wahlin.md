Time to review the web application stack! Carl and Richard talk to Dan Wahlin about his current explorations into building web applications. The current stack for Dan is Angular 2 on the front-end, ASP.NET Core on the backend and Docker as the hosting environment. There are so many cool capabilities in this configuration that it can affect the way you build software as a whole, making it easier to automate deployment, accelerate testing, distribute sample versions, and so on. This could be the future of .NET development!
