What the heck is Hybrid Transactional Analytical Processing (HTAP)? While at Ignite, Carl and Richard sat down with Lindsey Allen to talk about taking SQL Server "beyond relational." HTAP focuses on being able to do data analysis as data arrives in the database, independent of the transaction that actually wrote it. Lindsey talks about the power of being to get to near-real time with data analytics, rather than batch processing. Different than streams, you're still talking about data written to the database, so you already know your application logic and data integrity have been applied before you start your analysis. HTAP has huge potential for making super responsive applications!
