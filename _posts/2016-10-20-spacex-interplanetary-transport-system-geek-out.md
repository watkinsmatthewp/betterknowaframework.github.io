On September 27, 2016, Elon Musk held a press conference that was more like a rock concert to an excited crowd at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico. At the event, he announced the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS) and a plan to move a million people to Mars by 2050. How viable is this? Time for a Geek Out! Richard reviews the design of the Raptor engine, the ITS booster and spacecraft and the entire plan. This rocket is many times more powerful than anything ever built before. Will it work? What could you do with a rocket with this much power beyond the mission to Mars? Lots of possibilities!
