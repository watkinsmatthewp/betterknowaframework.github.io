Carl and Richard talk to James Montemagno, now a Microsoft employee since the Xamarin acquisition, about the on-going evolution of the Xamarin tools for building mobile and UWP applications.

James dives into the expanding set of capabilities that Xamarin Forms has to make folks more productive building mobile apps that have to work across iOS, Android and UWP. And testing is getting better too - check it out!
