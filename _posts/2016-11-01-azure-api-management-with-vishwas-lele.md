Are you afraid to make your API public? You should be! Carl and Richard talk to Vishwas Lele about Azure API Management, the safe an effective way to expose your API to the world and not take down your system. Vishwas talks about the array of problems in front of you once the public has access to your API: What happens if it's too popular for it's own good? Or someone builds runaway software that hammers it constantly? Or you want granular control over who can call your API, how often, and how fast? That's where Azure API Management comes in, taking on all of the front end side of APIs, even if you run the application behind the API on-premise. Check it out!
