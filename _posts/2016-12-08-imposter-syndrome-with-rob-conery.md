Are you an imposter? Carl and Richard talk to Rob Conery about his battle with imposter syndrome - starting with a definition. Rob talks about how often folks that don't have formal computing science education feel like they are faking it when it comes to software development, no matter how significant their contributions are. And part of his process for dealing with his own issues was to write a book on the subject - self-published. One of the focuses of the book is to dig into core concepts in computing science that are actually valuable in your day-to-day development efforts, such as estimating the difficulty of a computing problem or describing core algorithmic concepts. Learn from the smart people that have come before in computing!
