How are containers doing in the world today? While in Haarlem for DevIntersection Europe, Carl and Richard hosted a panel with Michele Bustamante, Dan Wahlin and Rick Van Rousselt about how they are currently working with containers and what they see coming in the future.

What will modern development look like in the next couple of years as containers take ahold of the entire development cycle? Exciting times!
