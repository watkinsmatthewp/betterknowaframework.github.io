As requested by a listener, a Geek Out on worldwide energy production! Richard starts out with a discussion on how to measure the energy production of humanity, and explores how energy is used on the planet - it's not just about electricity! Then into the hard stuff, looking through all sorts of energy sources including oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear, wind, solar and even geothermal. There's a lot of ways to make and consume power, some with more impact on the planet and some with less. What are the prospects going forward? Can we actually move away from fossil fuels, or is it just too expensive? Last Geek Out of the year, see you in 2017!
