How do you make your website progressive? Carl and Richard talk to Christian Heilmann about the latest approach in web development - the progressive web app (PWA). Christian talks about how PWAs really are progressive - you can add bits of these new capabilities to your existing web sites and see some benefit. It starts with the manifest that helps create an icon on a desktop or smartphone to get access to the website, so your user doesn't have to type the URL anymore. And it goes from there, adding offline capabilities, notifications and more. Different browsers are in different states of implementation with PWAs, but the movement is clear, doing more with web apps!
