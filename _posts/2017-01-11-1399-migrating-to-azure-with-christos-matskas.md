How do you migrate to Azure? Carl and Richard talk to Microsoft Premier Field Engineer Christos Matskas about his work helping companies move workloads to Azure. The conversation starts out focused on what you can move to Azure - which is less a technical problem and more of a political one. Christos discusses Azure Site Recovery as a sort of gateway drug for getting organizations into Azure - much cheaper than running a backup data center, Site Recovery keeps images of all your active servers so that you can switch over to them in a disaster. And then the catalog is opened up, there are a ton of products in Azure, which ones do you use? Lots of great discussion on the various approaches to moving to the cloud!
