How do you monitor your applications in Azure? Carl and Richard talk to Tom Kerkhove about his work with Azure Application Insights. AppInsights works with .NET, Java and nodeJS apps to allow detailed instrumentation of how your application is being used. Tom talks about doing deep tracing with AppInsights to be able to see a request come in on the front side of the application all the way back to the database. The conversation also digs into other levels of instrumentation including Operations Management Suite and Azure Monitoring. Getting the right data is the challenge, but it's worth it!
