2016 was an amazing year for space - what happens in 2017! Time for a Geek Out! Richard pulls together all his notes on the various players in the US space industry (and a few beyond the US). The big player, of course, is the United Launch Alliance (ULA). With pressure from SpaceX, ULA is starting to innovate - is this a good thing? And what about SpaceX? After the accident on Sept 1 2016, they're pushing hard to return to flight (and as this show publishes, should have just flown). There's also Blue Origin, Orbital ATK and a few companies you've never heard of that are sure to make some news in 2017 - exciting space times!
