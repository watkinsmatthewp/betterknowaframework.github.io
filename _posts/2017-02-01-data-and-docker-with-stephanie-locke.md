Can you use Docker with your database? While at NDC in London, Carl and Richard talk to Stephanie Locke about her experiences deploying database in containers. And as Stephanie says, you can deploy the database engine there, but the data has to live somewhere a bit more stable - like the cloud! The conversation digs into the power of containers for rapid deployment and upgrading, as well as the value of using different types of file stores for retaining data. In the end, a database creates files of data, and that's what you need to protect. Stephanie also talks about what databases make sense in different scenarios - it's not only about relational!
