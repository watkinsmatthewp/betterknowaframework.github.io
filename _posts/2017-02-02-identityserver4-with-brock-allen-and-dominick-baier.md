IdentityServer4 is all grown up! While at NDC in London, Carl and Richard sat down with Brock Allen and Dominick Baier to discuss their amazing open source product, IdentityServer. The conversation starts out where it left off last year, getting to the point of shipping IdentityServer with ASP.NET RC1. But literally a few hours later, RC2 was announced with serious breaking changes. The challenge of building software in the open! Dom and Brock talk through an implementation of IdentityServer using different federation sources, handling multi-tenancy and more. This is the right way to do identity!
