With apologies to Jane Austen, Carl and Richard talk to Dan North about the modern operations environment as one of the first NDC London shows of 2017. Dan digs into the challenges of operating modern applications and how a constant demand for new features can be destabilizing to software. The conversation explores getting to the root of concerns in systems so that everyone understands what is hard and what is easy. When people are misunderstood, fear and resistance almost always follow. Take the time to listen and get everyone working together well!
