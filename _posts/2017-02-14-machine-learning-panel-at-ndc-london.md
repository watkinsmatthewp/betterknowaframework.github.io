Are your machines learning? While at NDC in London, Carl and Richard hosted a panel of Jennifer Marsman, Evelina Gabasova and Barbara Fusinska talking about their work in machine learning. The conversation ranges over the variety of projects they've worked on, including using machine learning to analyze Stack Overflow data, building a machine learning-driven lie detector, doing sales data analysis with R, and more. The machine learning space is vast, and there are plenty of opportunities for everyone, you need to get exploring!
