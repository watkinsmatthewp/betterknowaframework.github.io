Will fusion power ever be real? Time for a geek out! Since the original fusion shows in 2014, there has been a bunch of progress in the field of fusion... okay, some progress. Richard talks about how ITER is delayed another ten years, the Wendelstein 7-X is actually up and running and the rest of the billionaire-funded fusion projects are somewhat quiet. Does that mean they have enough money so their working, or are they stuck? The discussion dives into a key challenge of fusion - more powerful magnets. And new magnet technology is on the horizon. Is this enough to make fusion power actually work? And is it even relevant anymore?
