How are software careers changing? Carl and Richard talk to Erik Dietrich about his new book, Developer Hegemony. Erik digs into the struggles that many developers have with the typical large enterprise, where software developers are treated more like cogs in the system, with limited amounts of information and flexibility. Leaving the company and contracting back increases your wages and flexibility, although now you are responsible for all the things that make your job your job - things like accounting, marketing, health insurance and so on. This leads to a more DevOps-like conversation that points to a future that is very software driven! It's a great time to be a developer!
