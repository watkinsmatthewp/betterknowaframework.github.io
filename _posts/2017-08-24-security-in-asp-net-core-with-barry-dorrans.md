How does security work in ASP.NET Core? Barry Dorrans knows, he's writing it! While at NDC Oslo, Carl and Richard sat down with Barry to talk about all his work in the security space at Microsoft. As Barry says, .NET Core represented a unique opportunity to reboot how security works on the web for the Microsoft stack, and he tried to do right by us all. Nothing is ever simple as you want it to be, especially when it comes to security, but there are good things available today if you spend some time to understand them. And a little scotch doesn't hurt either!
