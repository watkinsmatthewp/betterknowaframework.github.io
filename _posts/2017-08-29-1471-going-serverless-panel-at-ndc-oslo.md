Serverless is here - why would you do anything else? While at NDC Oslo, Carl and Richard hosted a panel of Rob Conery, Lynn Langit and Mathias Brandewinder to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the serverless approach to building applications. First up - the terrible name. Of course there are servers involved in serverless computing, you just don't have to think about them. The conversation spans over a number of different offerings, including AWS Lambdas, Azure Functions and Google Firebase. Serverless is worth serious study, there's a lot of potential!
