How do you get to know your customers? While at NDC Oslo, Carl and Richard talked to Diane Zajac-Woodie about empathy mapping, a process for trying to internalize the dimensions of your various customers. Diane talks about considering various dimensions of people, looking at what the see, hear, think, say and do. Empathy mapping is a way to get your team more engaged around what customer needs are, but they're only guesses - you also have to craft experiments to figure out the truth! In the end, the goal is to make the best software you can.
