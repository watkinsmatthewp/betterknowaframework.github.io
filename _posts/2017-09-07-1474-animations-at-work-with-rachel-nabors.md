Do you have animation in your work? Carl and Richard chat with Rachel Nabors about her work putting animation into web applications. The conversation starts out with a bit of a history lesson around early animation on computers, especially around touch - Rachel argues that what made the iPhone great was the keyboard animation metaphor so good you forgot you were typing on glass. Animation when done right just makes your software easier and more enjoyable to use - but it shouldn't be too noticeable! Want to learn more? You can get 10% off of Rachel's books and courses with the code NETROCKS.
