New to ASP.NET Core 2 is Razor Pages - how is it different from Razor? Carl and Richard talk to Jess Chadwick about how Razor Pages takes Razor to the next level, getting away from traditional MVC (which is a funny thing to say) and into a more flexible model with a simpler code-behind approach. Jess talks about how this approach often ends up more closely coupled, but in a lot of cases, that's just fine. The different techniques are not mutually exclusive, you can mix-and-match as needed. This leads to a great conversation about state management, server-side rendering and more - web development continues to evolve!
