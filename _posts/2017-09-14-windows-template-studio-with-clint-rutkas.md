Struggling to get started with Universal Windows Platform applications? Carl and Richard talk to Clint Rutkas about the Windows Template Studio (WTS). WTS was first released into the Studio marketplace at Build in 2017 and has been updating every six weeks or so - with lots of community contributions. Clint talks about striking the right balance between generating code automatically that demonstrates best practices and getting in the way of you writing your own code - it's never simple, but when done right, hugely powerful. WTS is an open source project on GitHub, you can contribute to it as well!
