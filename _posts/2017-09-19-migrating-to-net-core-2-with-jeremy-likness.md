.NET Core 2 is out - are you ready to migrate? Carl and Richard talk to Jeremy Likness about his experiences migrating his own projects over to Core 2 from .NET Framework. The latest version of Core has the vast majority of the base class libraries from the original framework implemented. Jeremy talks about his open source project called Sterling that hails back from the Silverlight days as a NoSQL data store. And it migrated fine! The conversation dives into other aspects beyond being cross platform, including performance benefits and what new technologies are on the horizon that may be Core-only. It's a great time to kick the tires on Core!
