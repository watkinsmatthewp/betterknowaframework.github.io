Event-driven architecture in Azure! Carl and Richard talk to Dan Rosanova about Azure Event Grid, built to power event-driven and serverless apps in Azure. Dan talks about how Event Grid picks up where WebHooks leave off, providing simpler connectivity between a variety of event streams and routing to different event consumers. The conversation also digs into the broader concepts of event-driven architecture, using queuing and subscription patterns to build loose-coupled, highly scalable and reliable applications. This is architecture perfect for the cloud!
