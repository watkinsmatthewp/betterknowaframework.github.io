How do you diagnose problems in your applications? While at ProgNet in London, Carl and Richard sat down with Jon Skeet to talk through how he does diagnostics and understanding bugs. The conversation starts out with a discussion around a comment that Richard read about writing great Stack Overflow questions by breaking down the problem into the smallest possible reproducible version. Jon talks about humility and diversity as cultural aspects in development teams that leads to better diagnostics and sharing. In the end, it's not the tech, it's the people that solve problems!
