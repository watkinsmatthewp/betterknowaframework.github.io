How would you make presentations better? While at ProgNet in London, Carl and Richard talked to Mark Rendle about his efforts to build a tool to make presentations more social - he calls it Shtik! The idea is to provide a cross-platform presentation tool using HTML so that it works on any platform (hence .NET Core) but also provides ways for the attendees to take notes and send feedback in real time. This opens the door to having the attendees of a presentation help direct it, offering a very different type of talk. It's early days, but everything is open source and Mark is looking for some help, so take Shtik out for a spin!
