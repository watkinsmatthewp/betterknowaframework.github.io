Core 2 is out, and with it, Entity Framework Core 2! While at ProgNet in London, Carl and Richard chatted with Julie Lerman about the latest version of Entity Framework Core. Julie talks about what's in, what's out and what's different - and it's a lot. The discussion digs into why you would use EF Core, including cases where you would use it with the regular Framework, not just with .NET Core. The team has taken the opportunity to do things differently, based on learnings from the original Entity Framework, giving EF Core some unique features and a pretty cool future. EF Core has more to come!
