There are so many messaging options in Azure, how do you choose? While at ProgNet in London, Carl and Richard sat down with Clemens Vasters to talk through the strengths and weaknesses of each messaging service. Clemens has been part of every messaging product in Azure, starting with Service Bus more than ten years ago. He discusses how customer needs and increasing demands in messaging resulted in making more specific products like Event Hub and IoT Hub. Azure Event Grid also fits a specific role in the discussion, making it easier for you to create message-driven workflows. Trying to sort out messaging in Azure? Clemens has the answers!
