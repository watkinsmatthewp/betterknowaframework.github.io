What can developers do with artificial intelligence? While at Ignite in Orlando, Carl and Richard sat down with David Carmona to talk about the latest AI offerings from Microsoft. The conversation starts out focused on some of the higher level issues in AI tech - the moral and ethical aspects. The major AI players in the world are collaborating to help develop standards to do the right things. Then David digs into the tooling available from Microsoft including all of the cognitive services, deep learning and analysis models. Lots of great things to experiment with!
