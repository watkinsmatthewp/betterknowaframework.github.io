DevOps with SQL Server? Yes! While at Ignite in Orlando, Carl and Richard sat down with Kevin Cunnane and Eric Kang to talk about the latest set of tooling in SQL Server to facilitate incorporating SQL Server databases into your DevOps workflows. Databases seem to be the biggest obstacles in the continuous deployment process - how do you make them part of the process? Kevin and Eric talk about the SQL Server Data Tools as a mechanism to allow database schema to be part of your source code and to be able to build deltas for version changes. Lots more tools in the show links, check them out!
