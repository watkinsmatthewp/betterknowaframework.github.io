How does Microsoft make Visual Studio Team Services? With Visual Studio Team Services! While at Ignite in Orlando, Carl and Richard sat down with Dan Hellem and Rogan Ferguson to talk about their work in the VSTS team building and deploying features on a three-week cycle. The discussion dives into the agile practices that the different teams use and how they come together to get new versions out on a regular basis as part of the Software-as-a-Service offering of VSTS. Great conversation about keeping developers productive!
