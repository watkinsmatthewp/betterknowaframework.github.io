Can everyone benefit from DevOps practices? While at Ignite in Orlando, Carl and Richard sat down with Donovan Brown and Damian Brady to talk about the recently formed League of Extraordinary DevOps Advocates and the effort to get both developers and operations folks taking advantage of Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Instrumentation tooling and more.
