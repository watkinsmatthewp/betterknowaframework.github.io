Ready to experiment with containers? Carl and Richard talk to Kendra Havens about the on-going integration of container technology into Windows, Visual Studio and .NET. Kendra talks about moving existing applications into Docker containers, and how even when the underlying operating system is large (say, Windows), you only need to download it once to use it across any number of container instances. There's great tooling for Docker support in Visual Studio and VS Code, so you can use Docker the way you want to. And Microsoft uses containers extensively internally as well, so the tooling just keeps getting better!
