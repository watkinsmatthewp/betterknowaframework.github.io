No anti-patterns this time - Steve is talking patterns! Carl and Richard chat with Steve Smith about various development patterns that can help you build software that is more reliable, scalable and robust. While Steve is famous for his anti-pattern calendars, this time around he's discussing a number of excellent patterns that are becoming more prevalent in the .NET development world, including the Builder pattern (which .NET Core relies on), Null Object Pattern, Strategy and Rules Patterns and more! If an hour isn't enough, check out Steve's books and Pluralsight videos!
