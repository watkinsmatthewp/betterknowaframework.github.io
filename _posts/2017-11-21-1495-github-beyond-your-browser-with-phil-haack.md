Ready to use GitHub beyond your browser? Carl and Richard talk to Phil Haack about his latest work at GitHub, where they are focused on expanding the audience that can rely on GitHub for social coding of all types. The discussion starts out focused on the rewrite of GitHub Desktop to Electron and the impact that has had for maintainability of code, and then moves to the latest work done to support game development in GitHub, specifically for Unity developers. Game development involves large digital assets like 3D models, movies and music - not the usual fodder for a Git repository. But Phil's team has build stuff to make life easier - check it out!
