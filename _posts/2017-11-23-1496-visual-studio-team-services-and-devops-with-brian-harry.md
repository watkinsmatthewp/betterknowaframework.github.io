Visual Studio Team Services continues to evolve! While at Connect in New York, Carl and Richard chatted with Brian Harry about the latest set of features coming out of the VSTS team. Brian talks about how Microsoft has been eating its own dog food and using VSTS everywhere, even with the development of Windows.
