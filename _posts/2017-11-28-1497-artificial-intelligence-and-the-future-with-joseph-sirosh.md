Where is Artificial Intelligence going at Microsoft? While at Connect in New York, Carl and Richard talked to Joseph Sirosh about his work with AI through the years and especially now while it's a new (and likely permanent) upswing. Sirosh talks about what it takes to let regular developers take advantage of AI technology by gluing different bits of tech together. There's a lot to know, but it is the future!
