Where has Visual Studio come from and where is it going? While at Connect in New York, Carl and Richard sat down with Connect owner/organizer Mitra Azizirad to talk about her show and long career at Microsoft. Mitra comes from a technical world but moved into developer marketing - and she's a huge fan of developers! Lots of interesting historical references about Visual Studio and more!
