Show 1500! What better to celebrate another aught-aught milestone of .NET Rocks than a look back. Richard has been working on writing a book on the History of .NET (maybe Christmas 2018?) but to celebrate a milestone show, he dives into the topic with Carl. .NET has had a lot of twists and turns through the years and .NET Rocks has been there the whole time - throughout the conversation, there are opportunities to point to specific shows that represent part of that history. Here's to another 1500 show and 15 years of .NET!
