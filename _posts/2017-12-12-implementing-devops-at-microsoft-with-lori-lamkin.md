What does it take to implement a DevOps practice at Microsoft? While at Connect in New York, Carl and Richard talked to Lori Lamkin about the efforts of the VSTS team to deliver more value to customers faster. Lori talks about changing the tempo of deployment for TFS from 24 months to three weeks and the re-organization of the teams so that developers are responsible for features from conception to operations. The role of operations also evolves to one that focuses on monitoring, rather than deployment - it's a lot of change, but worth it!
