The new version of DotVMM is imminent! Carl and Richard talk to Tom치코 Herceg about his on-going effort to build a great framework for creating web applications and migration paths away from web forms and other web pages bound to the .NET Framework over to .NET Core. Tom치코 discusses the new features coming in the latest version and his solutions to various problems around building web pages where the JavaScript is taken care of. And everything is open source - you have the code, modify it as you will! There are commercial versions available as well if you want to support this great set of tools!
