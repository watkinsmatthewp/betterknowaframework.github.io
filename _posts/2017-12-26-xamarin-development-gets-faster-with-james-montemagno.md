Mobile development continues to evolve in the Xamarin world! Carl and Richard talk to James Montemagno about the latest features coming out of the Xamarin team to make developing cross-platform native applications faster and easier. James digs into the new Xamarin Live tools that show your Xamarin app on your device with edit-and-continue capabilities. As you modify your Xamarin Forms code, the changes are immediately reflected in the device. This shortens the code-deploy-debug cycle so you can get more done in less time. The conversation also turns to XAML Standard and the challenges around bringing UWP, WPF and Xamarin Forms teams together to a common specification. James wraps up with a discussion on .NET embedding, letting you put your favorite .NET code into libraries that can be consumed by Objective-C, Swift and Java codebases!
