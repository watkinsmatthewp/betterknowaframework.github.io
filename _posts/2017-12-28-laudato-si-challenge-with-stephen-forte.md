Last show of 2017, how about a story about changing the world? Carl and Richard talk to Stephen Forte about the Laudato Si Challenge, a startup accelerator that focuses on conscientious capitalism, providing an intense ten-week program that helps the companies get moving with finance, marketing, and growth strategies. Stephen talks about the genesis of the challenge with Pope Francis' encyclical 'On Care of Our Common Home.' Making a profit doesn't have to be at the expense of the planet or other people - we can all benefit, and Stephen is working to make it true!
