A new year, and new features for ASP.NET! Carl and Richard kick off the new year by talking to Jeff Fritz about his on-going work on ASP.NET - both the framework and core editions. The conversation naturally turns to web forms, the big exclusion from the core edition, but new features continue to be released in .NET Framework 4.7.1. Jeff talks about what modern development looks like for ASP.NET web forms, and the power of continued support for existing web applications, while providing approaches for adding new capabilities like mobile development and more. It's going to be an exciting 2018!
