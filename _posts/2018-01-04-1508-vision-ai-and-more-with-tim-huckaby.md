Artificial Intelligence has transformed vision technology! Carl and Richard talk to Tim Huckaby about his latest work with vision systems for retail, security and more. Tim talks about how AI has fundamentally changed the way you implement vision systems, taking away many of the limitations on number of people tracked, object and face recognition and so on. The conversation digs into the demonstration done at the Build conference for using regular security cameras to implement a real-time safety tracking system on a construction site - aspirational, but coming soon! And of course, there's a long conversation about privacy. What is fair, reasonable and wise?
