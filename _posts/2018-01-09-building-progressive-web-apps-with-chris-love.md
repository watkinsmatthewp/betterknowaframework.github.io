Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are here, and Chris Love has some thoughts! Carl and Richard talk to Chris about his view on PWAs and their impact on building great web applications. Chris talks about the power of service workers to increase the performance of a web application through pre-loading of caching, tolerating unreliable connections, even cool event features that allow web apps to light up when they are needed, especially in a mobile scenario. Graceful degradation of features means that you build to the ideal browser, but tolerate versions that don't have comprehensive support for all PWA features. And check out Chris' offer for a PWA Course, special to .NET Rocks listeners!
