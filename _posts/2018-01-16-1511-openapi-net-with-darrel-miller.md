How do you make sure your APIs can interop across languages and other complexities? Carl and Richard talk to Darrel Miller about OpenAPI, the open source specification for standard aspects of APIs like collections, security rules and more. The specification is now at version 3 and starting to really mature - all the big players are involved, and you can contribute as well! Darrel discusses how Microsoft has been implementing OpenAPI standards to their own APIs and what it takes for you to do it as well. There is an OpenAPI.NET implementation available at GitHub for you to work from and lots of great information in Microsoft docs. Check it out!
