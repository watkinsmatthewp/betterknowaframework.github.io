How can storytelling advance your career? Carl and Richard talk to James Whittaker, who recently published The Storytellers Spellbook, about the power of stories to help people understand you and the things that are important to you. James tells his story about realizing how important storytelling was to his career and what it could do for him - and the additional challenge of teaching others how to tell stories. He breaks down three key aspects - the story you tell, how you tell it, and what you do while telling it. You don't have to be on stage, even your regular performance review at work is a type of storytelling, and it's in your best interest to get better at it!
