How do you get girls interested in programming and help them learn? While at NDC in London, Carl and Richard talk to Jennifer Wadella about her experience building Kansas City Women in Technology. Jennifer talks about trying to build a community of women peers in Kansas City, only to discover a huge group of women who wanted to get involved in technology. So off into the teaching practice, aimed at girls called Coding and Cupcakes and for women, an event called Coding and Cocktails. Lots of great thinking about how to make programming more approachable!
