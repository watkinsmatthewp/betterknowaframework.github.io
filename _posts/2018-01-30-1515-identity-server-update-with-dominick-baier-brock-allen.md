Another year goes by, time for an identity update! While at NDC in London, Carl and Richard talk to Dom and Brock about the latest updates to IdentityServer. A key aspect of the past year was two versions of .NET Core - both 1.1 and 2.0. Dom and Brock talk through all the twists and turns that it takes to keep IdentityServer up to date with the latest .NET Core pieces. So what about authentication? The conversation turns to the new PolicyServer available as both an open source and a retail product version. Identity continues to evolve!
