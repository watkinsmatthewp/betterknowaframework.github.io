How can space science help you learn Postgres? While at NDC London, Carl and Richard talk to Rob Conery about his latest book, A Curious Moon. Rob talks about being inspired by Andy Weir's The Martian to write a book that teaches Postgres by using the data from the NASA Cassini mission to Saturn. The book is part story, part tutorial about using Postgres, data loading and analytics. And the data is real - you're working from the actual data from the Cassini mission. The book is an innovative way to learn and starts you down the path of doing real data analytics, looking at what your data says!
