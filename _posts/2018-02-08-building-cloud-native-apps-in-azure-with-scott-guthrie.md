What does it mean to build a cloud-native application? While at NDC in London, Carl and Richard talked to Scott Guthrie about the latest features available in Azure. While there are always the Infrastructure-as-a-Service options of VMs and the like, you don't really get the power of the cloud until you move into more of the platform features. Scott describes how existing applications and be lifted-and-shifted into VMs in the cloud, and then broken apart to take advantage of various services. The ultimate manifestations use technologies that are cloud-specific, like CosmosDB and Logic App features so that you focuses solely on your code.
