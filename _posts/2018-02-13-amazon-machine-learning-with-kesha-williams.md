How is machine learning different over in the land of Amazon? While at NDC in London, Carl and Richard talked to Kesha Williams about her work building machine learning solutions using various Amazon technologies. The conversation starts out talking about the challenges around bias being amplified by machine learning technology - there are no simple solutions. Kesha talks about building a crime risk evaluation system using image recognition and machine learning. Just a prototype, but it opens the door to a deep conversation about the moral obligations on developers today. And the tech is cool too!
