Whether you're a multi-national NGO or your local church group, every non-profit has cybersecurity issues! Carl and Richard talk to Cameron Birge and Tarek Dawoud about tools, techniques and mindset to protect data and resist hackers. While the practices are broadly applicable to any organization and applications, non-profits have specific challenges that make cybersecurity all the more challenges - how do you train volunteers that turn over steadily? How can you be sure that a volunteer software developer is doing the right thing security-wise? Lots of good thinking about how to prioritize your security needs, it's a journey, not a destination!
