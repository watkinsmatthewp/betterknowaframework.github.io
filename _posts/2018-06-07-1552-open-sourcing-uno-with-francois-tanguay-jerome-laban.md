Where has Uno been all your life? Carl and Richard talk to Francois Tanguay and Jerome Laban about Uno - the open source cross-platform UX library based on the Microsoft Universal Windows Platform (UWP) - the other flavor of XAML! Francois and Jerome talk about using various versions of Uno the past four years to build cross-platform applications for Windows, Android and iOS - more than 200 of them! Now they have implemented a web assembly version as an experiment and are open sourcing the framework to broaden the community and explore more UX ideas - check it out!
