How can Azure help your applications be secure? Carl and Richard talk to Daniel Piessens about his experiences using various features of Azure to secure applications. The conversation starts out with application secrets stored in Azure Key Vault - not just for SSL certificates, any information that your application needs should be in there. To access it, you'll want Azure Active Directory, and that leads to a discussion on multi-factor authentication and increasing sophistication of identity - all features that come automatically from Azure. Whether your application is in the cloud or on-premises, you can make it more secure with these tools!
