Serverless technology can extend your applications! Carl and Richard talk to Glenn Block about his work at Auth0 and building out WebHooks. Glenn talks about taking WebHooks to the next level with Extend, providing a SaaS offering for extensibility into other SaaS applications. This leads to a conversation about the architecture of extensibility in the cloud - rather than building a ton of features, let your customers extend your software the way they want!
