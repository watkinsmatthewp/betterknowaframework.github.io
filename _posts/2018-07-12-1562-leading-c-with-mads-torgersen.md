Time for a chat with the leader of C#! Carl and Richard talk to Mads Torgersen about where C# has been and where it's going. Mads discusses some of the ideas being explored for what will become C# 8, including the on-going experiments with nullable reference types. The conversation dives into how language features are developed, the challenge of dealing with a huge diversity of developers in C# of varying skill levels and community engagement. Mads loves his role, and C# is better for it!
