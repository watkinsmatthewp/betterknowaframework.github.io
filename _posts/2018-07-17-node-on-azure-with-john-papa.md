Azure loves Node! Carl and Richard talk to John Papa about running JavaScript on the server side, in the cloud and otherwise. John talks about the tooling around doing web development in Azure, including the Azure CLI and more. The conversation also digs into the client side of development with VS Code and the huge array of extensions available that allow you to personalize and automate your development experience - the right tooling makes all the difference!
