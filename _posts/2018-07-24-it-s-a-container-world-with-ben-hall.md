Containerize all the things! Carl and Richard talk to Ben Hall about his on-going work with software in containers. Ben talks about Docker being pretty much synonymous with containers now, but when it comes to orchestration, there are a few more choices. Kubernetes seems to be the popular choice in the public cloud space, but Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos and Red Hat OpenShift all can play a role as well. Ben also digs into the role of serverless in a container world, and how these cloud-native architectures make you think about software differently!
