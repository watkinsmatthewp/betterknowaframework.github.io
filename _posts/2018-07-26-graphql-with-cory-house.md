GraphQL continues to evolve - should it be in your toolbox? Carl and Richard talk to Cory House about how he's been working with GraphQL. Cory talks about how he appreciates the lack of ceremony around GraphQL and it's strengths in dealing with a diversity of clients and bandwidth availability. Comparisons with oData are inevitable, and the jury is kind of out on it - both technologies are viable. GraphQL has a great ecosystem growing up around it, and is well worth a look if you need web-callable APIs!
