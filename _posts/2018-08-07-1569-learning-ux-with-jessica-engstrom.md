Ready to add UX to your skills? While in Berlin at the Telerik Modern Web Tour, Richard interviews Jessica Engstrom on how developers can add UX skills to their repertoire. Sure, it would be nice to have a dedicated UX person, but that's not always an option. So what do you need to know to get started? Jessica talks about the Tenets and Traps card deck that lists a variety of key tenets and the traps that you can fall into when it comes to making great UX experiences. Lots of great thinking!
