How should developers get started with Azure? Carl and Richard talk to Adam Cogan about his nine knights of Azure - in order, a set of services in Azure that developers should start with. Right off the bat, Adam suggests staying clear of the fancy cloud techs like containers and serverless. Start simple with Azure Web Apps, then start working on continuous integration and deployment. There are a ton of moving parts in Azure, and Adam has a great plan for getting your application and your skills gradually up to speed so that you can take them all on!
