What the heck is Twitch, and why would you want to code on it? Carl and Richard talk to Jeff Fritz about his experiences building a TwitchTV livestream for coding with .NET. What started as an experiment has grown to thousands of viewers and streams that happen several times a week. Jeff talks about the power of reaching new audiences and how the digressions during streams turn into the most important bits. Is live stream coding a good way to learn? How does it compare to other techniques? And just for fun - we recorded this show on his Twitch channel!
