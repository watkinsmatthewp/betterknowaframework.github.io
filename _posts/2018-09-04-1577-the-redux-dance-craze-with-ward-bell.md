The Redux Dance Craze is on! Carl and Richard talk to Ward Bell about how Redux has becoming a key player in state management for UX stacks in modern Single Page Application development. Although Redux was originally a library to support the React component model, today there are implementations of Redux for almost any Javascript UI solution - including Angular! Ward talks about how Redux and reactive architecture makes a cleaner, tidier and more maintainable UI solution. And lots of great side conversations about various aspects of web development along the way!
