The Internet of Things keeps evolving! Carl and Richard talk to Suz Hinton about her on-going work in the IoT space, including joining Microsoft! It's been five years since Suz created the MeowShoes, and the combination of Moore's Law and the Cloud has made IoT more powerful and less expensive at the same time. Suz talks about coding in JavaScript via NodeJS to deploy code to all sorts of devices, along the way mentioning that operating systems just don't matter much, these days you can program what you want with whatever you want. Security continues to be a key issue, but things are looking up with smart ecosystems like Azure Sphere on the way. More IoT FTW!
