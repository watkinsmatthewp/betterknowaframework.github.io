Time to rub a little DevOps on it! Carl and Richard talk to Donovan Brown about the state of DevOps at Microsoft - including some important changes! The conversation starts out talking about the latest tooling making it easier than ever to get a great automated pipeline of continuous delivery. But that's not enough, there's a cultural shift that has to happen also. Donovan talks about how IT folks can resist the changes that come with rapid deployment, and Richard argues back about how IT roles struggle - the solution is to create common goals around value to the customer. Meantime, there's big news at Microsoft - Visual Studio Team Services is becoming Azure DevOps, and opening the door to a more diverse way to rub more DevOps on everything you do!
