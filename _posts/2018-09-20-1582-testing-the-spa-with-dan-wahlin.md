How do you test a single page application? Carl and Richard talk to Dan Wahlin about cypress.io, Dan's favorite new open source library for testing anything in the browser, including SPAs like Angular, React and Vue. The conversation dives into the various challenges around testing for web apps, trying to get beyond unit testing and into more functional testing that will let you know if you broke the UI. Dan talks about taking over existing projects that have chunks of code that everyone fears - and how testing helps mitigate that fear. As usual with Dan, he also compares and contrasts various web stacks - lots of great links in the show notes too!
