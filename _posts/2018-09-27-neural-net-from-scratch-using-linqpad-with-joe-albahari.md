Can you build a neural net from scratch? While at NDC in Sydney, Carl and Richard talked to Joe Albahari about using LINQPad to create neural nets from scratch. LINQPad is an interactive development environment for .NET - originally focused on helping you build LINQ expressions. But as Joe explains, it can be used for all sorts of interactive coding experiences - including learning to build neural networks. Joe talks through the fundamentals of neural nets and what it's like to build neural nets yourself. Even if you move on to more advanced machine learning tooling, learning the fundamentals are useful!
