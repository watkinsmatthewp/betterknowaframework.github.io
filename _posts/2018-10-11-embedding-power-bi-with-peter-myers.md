What can PowerBI do for you? While at NDC in Sydney, Carl and Richard talked to Peter Myers about Microsoft's modern data analytics tool. The conversation starts out exploring the history of data analytics at Microsoft and how it has landed at PowerBI. Peter talks about how PowerBI is both a Software-as-a-Service tool and Platform-as-a-Service component. You can embed PowerBI in your applications to do dashboards and dynamic reporting. It consumes virtually any data source and has great programmatic extensibility - add it to your application!
