Call it an impromptu Geek Out! While at NDC Sydney, Carl and Richard talked to Agustinus Nalwan about his work with artificial intelligence technology in his company. This leads to a larger conversation about the risks around AI and the idea that we may be approaching the Singularity - which according to Gus is where technology continues to teach itself. Richard chimes in on the debate around the Singularity from Ray Kurtzweil, exploring how humans could integrate with technology and what that would mean to society as whole. Lots of philosophy, and perhaps even pushing against the edges of spirituality, this isn't a technical show, but it sure is geeky!
