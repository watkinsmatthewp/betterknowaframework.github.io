Happy 1600 - time for a Geek Out! Richard and Carl discuss superconductors - where they come from and what they can do for us. The tricky part is figuring out how and why superconductors even work. There have been a number of theories postulated along the way about superconductors, but they involve aspects of atomic science that are not fully understood. Today superconductors are in a number of products, including MRI machines, various kinds of sensors, high powered motors and MagLev trains - who knows where they will turn up next!
